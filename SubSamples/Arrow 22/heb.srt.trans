. The only time I'll ask
70
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:36,955
. A friendly conversation between mother and son
71
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:45,655

. While Tommy ran the affairs
76
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,760
. Tommy is a good guy
. Well -
77
00:04:01,336 --> 00:04:03,086
And you
What do you mean -
78
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:07,085

80
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:11,862
And explain to him that you
. Has feelings for me
81
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,151
, But instead
82
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,267
. Told me that you have feelings
83
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:21,522
, As I'm sure you can imagine
. Could not think of much since
84
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,318

So why did you say -
85
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:26,170

I did not mean make it difficult to
. To fix the situation with Tommy
89
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,263

Maybe he and I
. Were never meant to be together
100
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:14,829

00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:24,786
. And it will destroy the economy of China
Especially ...
234
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:29,994
After the Chinese military makes errant
Taking charge

. Wait here
250
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,654
I do not know
. It seems a little jump
251
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,709
Yeah, that's what they do
When you have nothing
252
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:40,155
I only know that the imitator
. " Burned all the documentation on " Ionidk
253
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,059
And we only record calls
Whereby this Markov
254
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,823
Made a number of line calls
. " Not logged on " Merlin Global
255
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,053
â€¢ Multiple calls
256
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,221
. Said jump ? I was wrong
. Meant a huge skip
257
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:52,035
Just bring someone here
" From " Merlin Global
258
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,515

What about you?
? Discovered something the police
263

To be honest ...
264
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,560

265
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,036
? Know the rainbow copycat
. Well -
266
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:15,302
It turns out he was connected
. To " Merlin Global " somehow
267
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,019
. , Or at least his victims
268

Seems that the guy with the black arrows
Hate it ... with green arrows
270
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,580
So what ? Just will perform on " Merlin

But I never meant

I need to remove all

00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:18,514
"It is known that " Kevin Consolidated

. Then met
317
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,007
I need information
. To what I do not know
318
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,951
Ionidk " is a small company
Of research and technological development
319
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,541
. Specializing in seismic
320
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,845
Merlin plans to make the Glades
321
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,075
With a device that makes
. Artificial earthquake
322
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:38,798
. You laugh
323
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,375
What else is written
324
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,380
More information about the sale
's Public shareholders ... and
325
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,384
The latest news on what
The media calls him ...
326
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:47,487
. " Massacre " - Ionidk
327
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:50,223
No way this timing
. Coincidence is
328
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:51,525
Oliver , has a website
329
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:53,987
Police claims
. Suspect copycat request
330
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:57,117
! ? What
So pressing the other works for Merlin -
331
00:17:57,321 --> 00:18:00,717
. Closes open ends
Deletes any evidence for device
332
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,352
So no one could get
. To investigate the destruction
333
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,467
So you're going to run
. Serious conversation with Mr. Merlin
334
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:07,975
, Even if you take off the Merlin
. Yet another bow out
335
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,904
. They can operate the device
. We need to find it
336
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:12,066
. Then Merlin got what he deserved
337
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,092
Maybe there is another way
. To make Merlin tell us
338
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,472
, What did you think
339
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,631
