1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,359
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,629
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:10,114
survive.

4
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:11,932
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:14,151
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:16,654
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:20,241
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:20,243 --> 00:00:24,111
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:27,381
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:28,782
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:30,551
Rescuing your father
and stopping Fyers

12
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:32,470
is not going to be
some walk in the park.

13
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:35,172
Yao Fei!
Ba!

14
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:37,174
How did you
escape?

15
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:40,694
I didn't.

16
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:42,513
You told me to stay away
from your family and I did,

17
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:44,532
but your family isn't
staying away from me,

18
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:46,734
which means something
must be done about it.

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,987
You're going home.

20
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:51,572
About my mother,

21
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:53,657
and about her involvement
in the Undertaking.

22
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,326
She's working
with Malcolm Merlyn,

23
00:00:55,328 --> 00:01:00,164
and they're planning
something terrible.

24
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:04,151
So, I was
wondering--

25
00:01:04,153 --> 00:01:06,203
there's a late night
happy hour at Stella's.

26
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,755
You know, the place
across the street.

27
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:09,656
You mean the place
that's always playing

28
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:12,093
loud salsa music at all hours
when I'm trying to work late?

29
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,511
That--that would be
the one, yeah.

30
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:16,163
Anyway, I was
thinking that, um,

31
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:18,382
maybe, you know,
if you wanted to,

32
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:20,684
we could perhaps
grab a drink?

33
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:24,271
How about two?

34
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:27,308
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,726
Please.

36
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:31,729
I did everything
Mr. Merlyn required of me!

37
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:33,847
He knows,
Dr. Markov,

38
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,866
and he thanks you
for your service.

39
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:46,410
Open the door!
Open the door!

40
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:48,078
Freeze!

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,217
No!
Open the door!

42
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:56,887
Get down on the floor!

43

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,390
I've been watching
your mother for days

46
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:32,374
now, Oliver, and nothing.

47
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,125
She goes to work,

48
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:37,211
she comes home. Occasionally
she goes out for dinner.

49
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:40,247
She seems to particularly
like the salmon tartar at table salt.

50
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:41,682
I'm linked into her home
and office phone.

51
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:43,300
Nothing out
of the ordinary.

52
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,852
No mention of Walter's abduction
or the Undertaking.

53
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:47,271
Just a few innocuous calls
to Malcolm Merlyn.

54
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:49,440
Why wouldn't she
call him?

55
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:52,926
They're old friends.

56
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:55,696
We're all
old friends.

57
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:59,149
Are you ok?

58
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:01,535
My mom and my best
friend's dad

59
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:02,987
are involved
in a conspiracy

60
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,955
that may have dire
consequences for the city.

61
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:06,991
And I'm pretty sure
they murdered my father.

62
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,765
I'm not planning
on using the word "ok"

63
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,413
again any time soon.

64
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:13,447
Listen, all we know for sure
is that Malcolm

65
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,299
and your mother are planning
something for the glades.

66
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:17,134
And that Walter and I
were getting too close to it,

67
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:18,586
that's why
they had him kidnapped.

68
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:20,054
We have to find out
what this Undertaking is.

69
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:22,623
I got to ask her.

70
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,476
Well, no. The last time the Vigilante
paid your mom a visit,

71
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:28,345
you got shot, and I got
to play doctor with you.

72
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:31,465
Ahh! My brain thinks
of the worst way to say things.

73
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,800
This time it'll
just be me asking.

74
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,654
Friendly
mother-son chat.

75
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:48,415
Laurel? What are you doing here?
It's not even 7:00 a.m.

76
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,918
That's just after
closing time, right?

77
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,004
How's business?

78
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:55,623
Well, it's busy.

79
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,208
Busy. It was easier when
Tommy was running things.

80
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,461
Tommy's a good guy.
Yeah.

81
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:02,296
Are you?

82
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:03,430
What do you mean?

83
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,182
Last week,
I told you

84
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:06,884
that I wanted
to get back with Tommy.

85
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:08,969
That I needed you
to go to him

86
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:12,389
and explain to him that you
didn't still have feelings for me.

87
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:14,358
But instead,

88
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,677
you told me that you did.

89
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:19,680
As I'm sure you can
probably imagine,

90
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:21,915
I haven't been able
to think of much since.

91
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:25,052
I shouldn't
have said that.

92
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:26,520
Then why did you?

93
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:29,206
I didn't...
have an agenda.

94
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,905
I didn't mean to make it
more difficult for you

95
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,599
to fix things with Tommy.

96
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,330
But what if you did?

97
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,637
After you disappeared--

98
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,308
with Sara--

99
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,094
I was sorry
I ever knew you.

100
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:52,821
But now, things
have happened that

101
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:54,566
I never thought would.

102
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,568
You coming home.

103
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,106
My parents being
in the same room.

104
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:04,224
And you.

105
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,777
What if I'm finally
starting to see you

106
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,412
for who you really are?
No, Laurel, it's--

107
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:10,114
And maybe
Tommy was right.

108
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:12,116
Maybe he and I
weren't meant to be.

109
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:15,669
Maybe I'm finally
ready to admit that...

110
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:19,123
that I still have
feelings for you, too.

111
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,595
Nothing's changed.

112
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:27,214
My life hasn't changed.

113
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:29,516
I haven't changed.

114
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:33,937
I got to go.

115
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,057
Walter's coming home.

116
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:49,319
Everything's exactly
as you left it.

117
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,955
How are you feeling,
Walter?

118
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,874
I'm on the mend,
thank you, Oliver.

119
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:55,676
Oh, I'm so glad
you're home.

120
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:57,127
That makes two of us.

121
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,879
All of us.

122
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,914
We've prepared
a delicious brunch for you.

123
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,049
All your favorites.

124
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:04,068
Oh, yum,
English food.

125
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,620
Actually, I'm more tired from
the drive than I expected.

126
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:09,139
So I think I'd like
to lie down for a bit.

127
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:12,025
Yes, of course.

128
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:29,693
Walter doesn't really
seem like himself.

129
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,929
He's gone through a lot.

130
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:35,432
It's just...
going to take a little bit of time.

131
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:37,484
I'm really sick of us

132
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:40,087
all having to go through
a lot, you know?

133
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,677
Six scientists
and three security personnel

134
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,912
are confirmed killed
in the massacre.

135
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:52,533
Among the dead, respected
seismologist Brian Markov.

136
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:54,334
A spokesperson
for Unidac Industries

137
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:55,686
says a comment
would be forthcoming.

138
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:56,770
Mom, we need to talk.

139
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:59,339
Oh, uh, later,
Oliver.

140
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:01,007
...co-workers, parents
and families of all the victims

141
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,861
to see how they're coping
with their loss.

142
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:35,208
You!
Save it.

143
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,211
We don't have the luxury
of indulging in vendettas.

144
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:39,813
Ba!
Shado.

145
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:42,349
You led Fyers
right to us, you coward!

146
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,235
Fyers was about
to fire bomb the entire forest

147
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:46,487
just to eliminate you.

148
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,889
This way, you all
have a chance.

149
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:51,408
Well, pray I don't get the
chance to repay your mercy.

150
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,226
How fitting.

151
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:55,195
Everyone reunited
for the end.

152
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:57,948
The end of what?
What is all this for?

153
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,585
HKIA, this is
Ferris Air flight 637 out of Paris,

154
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:03,570
nonstop to Hong Kong.

155
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:06,039
We are steady on approach
at 33,000 feet

156
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,741
and winds at 15 knots.

157
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:10,043
ETA, two hours,
15 minutes, over.

158
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:12,746
Ferris 637, this is hkia.

159
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:14,515
Adjust course
to 0.6 degrees south.

160
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,433
11 minutes, over.

161
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,302
Roger, HKIA.
Why the course change?

162
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:20,470
Nothing to worry about, 637.

163
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:22,923
Just looking to make sure
you avoid a little turbulence.

164
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:24,775
Roger that.
Adjusting course now.

165
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:26,276
They're altering course,
sir. The plane

166
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,061
will be in range
of Lian Yu in 26 minutes.

167
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:29,863
Good. Keep tracking it.

168
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,949
That's a commercial
airliner, Fyers.

169
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:33,417
It's not like it can land here.

170
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,569
It won't be landing
anywhere, Mr. Queen.

171
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,487
I'm going to destroy it.

172
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:44,545
Arrows are black,
not green.

173
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:45,913
Copycat archer again.

174
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,714
Psychopaths are color-coding
themselves now.

175
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,550
That's helpful.
Yeah, except we haven't seen

176
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,134
the copycat in quite a while.

177
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:53,554
Ok, last time he took hostages
to draw out the Vigilante.

178
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,790
This time, he massacres
a bunch of lab nerds?

179
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:59,459
I want a press lockdown, nobody
hears about the other archer

180
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,061
and we need to get a list
of all Unidac employees

181
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,846
and find out what
they're working on here.

182
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:04,598
Apparently it was
a tight group.

183
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,633
Anyone who knows
anything about the project is dead.

184
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,819
And the copycat fried all their
computers and burned their research.

185
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:10,804
Whatever's
going on here,

186
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:13,190
someone doesn't want
anyone to know about it.

187
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:17,077
Where did you even
get that camera?

188
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:20,664
Come to think of it,
where did you get this car?

189
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,115
I borrowed it.

190
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:23,700
Illegally.

191
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,836
You know, when I imagine
being in a car with you,

192
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:27,838
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

193
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,489
Yeah, well,
you're the one

194
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:30,907
who said you'd help me
find the Vigilante.

195
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:32,542
I know,
but it's been two weeks,

196
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,494
and the closest we've come
is snapping photos

197
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:36,264
of the cop who hates
the Hood just as much

198
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,632
as you worship him.

199
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:38,849
I don't worship him.

200
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,851
I just need
to find him.

201
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,837
You don't need to find him
to be somebody.

202
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,173
Besides, it's not like you're going
to meet him any time soon.

203
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:50,277
Just that the cops
don't have a clue.

204
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,780
We don't know
what they know.

205
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:57,901
Ok, I officially
do not like that look.

206
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:00,237
You still work
at CNRI, right?

207
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,662
Hey, Mom.

208
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:12,198
Walter's upstairs resting.

209
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,668
I think he's...
doing well, don't you?

210
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,720
Who took him?

211
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:19,306
Well, we don't know yet.
But I'm going to make sure

212
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,892
all the resources of Queen
Consolidated are behind it.

213
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:24,344
That's the answer that you
gave to reporters yesterday.

214
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:28,482
Tell me the truth.

215
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:30,150
I don't know
what you mean.

216
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:32,269
I think you do.
A couple months ago,

217
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:33,991
when I showed you dad's
notebook, you seemed

218
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,406
to know something.

219
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,491
Something about our
family being in danger.

220
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:39,776
Are you suggesting
that I knew something

221
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:41,895
about my husband's kidnapping?

222
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:43,697
I'm just suggesting that
maybe you were scared.

223
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,650
That maybe you didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

224
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:48,902
But it was harder
than you thought.

225
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:51,038
And now you're barely keeping
your head above water.

226
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,573
Please, Mom.

227
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:56,126
Let me help you
before you drown.

228
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:59,129
You need to stop asking these things.
Do you understand?

229
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:00,981
I need you to stop.

230
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:02,432
I can't.

231
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:04,618
I need to know.

232
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,853
Is that a power outage?

233
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:08,638
I don't know.

234
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,727
Oliver! Oliver!

235
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,260
Mom!

236
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:40,845
Oliver.

237
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,064
Are you ok?

238
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,432
Oliver?

239
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,601
What--what--

240
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:49,070
we got to get
out of here.

241
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:51,489
Moira Queen...

242
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:54,008
You have failed the city.

243
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:57,161
It doesn't make any sense!

244
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,896
Why do you want
to blow up a plane?

245
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,665
When the New York
Stock Exchange

246
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,083
reopened after 9-11,

247
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:06,003
the Dow Jones dropped
nearly 685 points.

248
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,905
Can you imagine
what would happen to China,

249
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,290
the world's second
largest economy,

250
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,792
if all air travel
in and out of China

251
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:13,344
were to be grounded
indefinitely?

252
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:16,180
You want to destabilize
China's economy?

253
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:19,600
It's not what I want,
but rather my employer.

254
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,636
We have enough
missiles here

255
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:24,355
to shoot down any aircraft
approaching the mainland.

256
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:27,608
And that will
decimate China's economy.

257
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,944
Especially...
once a rogue element

258
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:32,980
in China's own military
claims responsibility.

259
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:37,434
You see, inconvenient
though you occasionally were,

260
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:41,205
you're always worth
more to me alive than dead.

261
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:42,873
Then you should
have killed me.

262
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,076
Because I won't do it.

263
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:52,233
Ahh!

264
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:55,002
Shado! Shado!

265
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:57,221
I said I need you alive,

266
00:12:57,223 --> 00:13:00,007
but I can kill
everyone you care about.

267
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:10,601
Help you with something?

268
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:13,320
Yes, um, I'm from CNRI

269
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:16,791
and we're investigating claims
of racial bias in SCPD arrests.

270
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:19,427
So I'm going to need
a copy of each file

271
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,631
from every arrest in
Starling City January,

272
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:23,656
2011 to the present.

273
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,366
It's almost 9:00 at night.

274
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,034
Yeah, well, tell that
to Judge Crow.

275
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:28,703
He's the one who signed
the court order.

276
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:34,658
Wait here.

277
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,844
I don't know, it seems
like a bit of a reach.

278
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:38,929
Yeah, which is what you do
when you got nothin'.

279
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:40,431
'Cause all I know
is the copycat,

280
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,833
he torched every record
down at Unidac.

281
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,685
And all we got are
phone records

282
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,503
and they show
that this Markov guy,

283
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:49,006
he made a couple of calls to
an unclaimed line at Merlyn Global.

284
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,142
A couple of calls?
Did I say reach?

285
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,060
I misspoke. I meant leap.

286
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:54,945
Just get someone down
here from Merlyn Global

287
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:57,364
to answer a few
questions under oath.

288
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:03,120
Did you find anything?

289
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,354
Lots.

290
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:06,523
Anything helpful?
No, still looking.

291
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,692
What about you?
You learn anything from the cops?

292
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:11,212
As a matter
of fact...

293
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:12,696
I like the sound of that.

294
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,215
You know that
copycat archer?

295
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:16,083
Yeah.

296
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,535
Turns out he's connected to
Merlyn Global somehow.

297
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:20,221
Or, at least
his victims are.

298
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:22,873
We're looking for the Hood,
not some crazy wannabe.

299
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,925
Well, the guy
with the black arrows

300
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:26,543
seems to hate the guy
with the green arrows, so...

301
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:28,312
So what, we just
show up at Merlyn Global

302
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,397
and hope the Hood
shows up, too?

303
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,933
Last I checked,

304
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:35,186
you don't have
any better ideas.

305
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,823
Please!

306
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:41,075
Do not hurt my son.

307
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:44,328
Tell me what the Undertaking is
and I won't have to.

308
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:53,871
No!
Tell me!

309
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,256
Please!

310
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:56,907
Leave my son alone!

311
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,542
What is Malcolm Merlyn
planning?!

312
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:00,761
I can't tell you!

313
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:04,131
He'll kill me,
he'll kill my family.

314
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,051
You should be more worried
about what I'll do.

315
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,087
No!

316
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,274
Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades!

317
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:17,228
He said so he could
rebuild it, but...

318
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,280
How?

319
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:21,699
There's a device.
What device?!

320
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:24,952
He says that it can
cause an earthquake.

321
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:26,287
How is this possible?

322
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,621
I don't know.

323
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:31,408
It was invented
by Unidac Industries.

324
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,946
Malcolm used my company's
Applied Sciences

325
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:39,333
to turn it
into a weapon.

326
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:44,421
Why would you get involved
in something like this?

327
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:47,525
My husband...

328
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:50,477
He got involved
without my knowing.

329
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,513
He was just trying
to do some good.

330
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:54,899
He was lost. He...

331
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:58,485
His decisions
left me vulnerable

332
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:00,688
to Malcolm,
and I had no choice.

333
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,190
I had to protect
my family and my children.

334
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:06,026
This device...
Where is it?

335
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:07,811
I don't know.

336
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:09,580
If you don't tell me,
I can't stop Merlyn!

337
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,665
Oh, you can't stop him.

338
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,502
It's too late.

339
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:23,460
No, no, no,
I told you everything!

340
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:32,836
Oliver!

341
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,139
No!
Oh, sweet--

342
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,192
Please, I know what you must be
thinking, sweetheart,

343
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,728
but I never intended
any of this to happen.

344
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:44,114
You know I would
never willingly

345
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:46,450
be a part of
anything like this.

346
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,990
I don't know anything anymore.

347
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,518
Oh, my God.

348
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,018
You said you were going
to pull your punches!

349
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,471
I did.
Let me get you an icepack for...

350
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:16,056
Everything.
I'm fine.

351
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:18,863
I need you to dig up
everything you can

352
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,239
on Unidac Industries.

353
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,213
Well, we know Queen Consolidated
acquired them seven months ago.

354
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:26,099
That's when we met.

355
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:29,051
I need information
about what I don't know.

356
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:32,619
Unidac is a small
research and development

357
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:34,090
technology company

358
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:38,277
that specializes in
seismic infringement.

359
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,279
Merlyn plans on
leveling the Glades

360
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,199
with a device that triggers
a manmade earthquake.

361
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,651
You're kidding.

362
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:47,703
What else
does it say?

363
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:49,956
More information
on the stock auction

364
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,824
and, you know,
the latest

365
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:53,209
on what the media's
calling--

366
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:54,627
The Unidac massacre.
There's no way

367
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:55,878
this timing is a coincidence.

368
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,630
Oliver,
there's a website

369
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:00,282
claiming the police
suspect a copycat archer.

370
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:02,718
What?!
So the other archer works for Merlyn?

371
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,004
He's tying up
loose ends.

372
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:06,672
Erasing all evidence
this device exists

373
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:09,642
so no one can trace
the devastation back to him.

374
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:11,978
All right, so you're going to have a
pointed conversation with Mr. Merlyn.

375
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,129
Well, even if I take out Merlyn,
the other archer is still out there.

376
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,482
He can set off the device.
We need to find it.

377
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,467
Then Merlyn
can get his.

378
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:21,187
Well, maybe there's another
way to get Merlyn to tell us.

379
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:22,822
What do you have in mind?

380
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:25,658
As I keep proving,
people keep secrets.

381
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,993
Computers don't.

382
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:29,162
Felicity, are you hacking

383
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:30,646
into the Merlyn
Global mainframe?

384
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:32,448
"Hacking" is such
an ugly word.

385
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,617
No. I'm...

386
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,337
Yeah, totally hacking
into the Merlyn Global mainframe.

387
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:41,224
Stop!

388
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,658
I'll do it.

389
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,961
I knew your good judgment
could be counted on.

390
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,879
Come along now.

391
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,347
We need to get you
back into uniform.

392
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:17,326
It's Fyers.
It's happening.

393
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,245
Understood.

394
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:20,963
That was Fyers.

395
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:24,550
Everything is proceeding
to your plan.

396
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,839
It truly is very kind of
you to come all the way out here.

397
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:32,592
Walter?

398
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:35,094
Who are you
speaking to--

399
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,729
Moira.

400
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:38,064
How are you?

401
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,699
Well.
Thank you.

402
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:41,984
Actually, you look
a little bit out of sorts.

403
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:43,936
Oh, no, no,
I'm fine.

404
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:48,774
Malcolm stopped by
to check up on his nemesis.

405
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:50,526
On the racquetball court.

406
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,446
I didn't get a chance
to talk to Walter

407
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:54,947
at the hospital.
Like everyone,

408
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:58,167
I'm glad he's back
where he belongs.

409
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:59,936
With his family.

410
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:02,622
Yes.

411
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:04,090
I'll let you get
some rest.

412
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,092
Thanks again.
Yeah.

413
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:08,995
Uh, I'll
walk you out.

414
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:13,466
Your assassin
wasn't too subtle

415
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:15,268
in eliminating those
people at Unidac.

416
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,520
Well, now the police are focused
on the copycat archer

417
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,855
instead of the Undertaking.
As for our collateral damage,

418
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:21,807
I had to limit our exposure.
I see.

419
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,643
And does paying Walter
a visit just now

420
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,645
fall under
the same category?

421
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,697
You held him
for nearly six months.

422
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:30,449
Surely you had him questioned.
He was.

423
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,201
And I assume
that if Walter knew

424
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:34,420
something you'd rather he
didn't, agreement be damned,

425
00:20:34,422 --> 00:20:37,573
I would be a widow again.
Am I wrong?

426
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,875
Rarely.

427
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:45,498
Well, we discovered
a few phone calls

428
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,166
between one
of the Unidac victims

429
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:49,618
and someone
at the Merlyn Global group.

430
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,121
Which is why I asked
for someone at your company

431
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:54,289
to help me
with my investigation.

432
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,528
But naturally, they send down
the one guy that's been

433
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,411
working there 30 seconds
and knows nothing.

434
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:02,131
Detective Lance,
if someone from Merlyn Global

435
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,549
is involved
with those deaths,

436
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:05,234
I want them found
as much as you do.

437
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:08,804
Give me more to go on
than some phone calls

438
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:10,431
and I will help you
in any way that I can.

439
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:12,432
Thank you.

440
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:17,813
What are you
doing here?

441
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:21,951
Helping your father
with an investigation.

442
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:24,754
Uh...

443
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:26,488
Call me

444
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,174
if you need
anything else.

445
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:31,043
Thank you.

446
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:34,547
One second, sweetie.

447
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:36,265
Ok, someone at Merlyn Global
could be connected

448
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,147
to the copycat archer,
all right?

449
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:39,673
Any chance you can have
a little snoop around

450
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,178
their computer systems?

451
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:42,440
You'll need a warrant.

452
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:46,276
No, we'll need a judge
who owes me a favor.

453
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:48,878
Hey.

454
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,715
You never did tell me what had
you and Merlyn on the outs.

455
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:54,267
No, I didn't.

456
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:57,720
You don't have to tell me.

457
00:21:57,722 --> 00:22:00,857
Oliver.

458
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,525
Come on.

459
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:05,194
I know.
I know. Say it.

460
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:08,013
You--you think
I'm crazy.

461
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:09,866
I mean, Oliver,
he cheated on me,

462
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:12,151
he broke my heart,
he led Sara to her death

463
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:14,497
and you would probably
rather drink acid than

464
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:15,706
see me with him again.

465
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:18,458
Dad...

466
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,827
I am sure you're
disappointed in me.

467
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:30,753
Since Queen's been back, he's...

468
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:33,239
Different.

469
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,910
I'll deny ever
having said that.

470
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:40,096
Hmm.

471
00:22:41,348 --> 00:22:43,566
Let's eat.

472
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:51,724
Anything?

473
00:22:51,726 --> 00:22:53,993
Just for the record,
I will pump my fist in the air

474
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:55,945
and scream, "yes!"
If I get in.

475
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:57,246
You know, you can just say
this isn't working.

476
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:58,664
This isn't working.

477
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,166
All right, there has
to be some other way

478
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:01,667
we can find out where
he's keeping this device.

479
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:03,736
Unless I can waltz up
to Merlyn's mainframe

480
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:05,488
and plug in my tablet directly, there's
no way of getting that location.

481
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,340
Then we waltz.

482
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,041
Excuse me?

483
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:10,743
You need direct access
to the mainframe,

484
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:12,428
so we get you direct access
to the mainframe,

485
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,797
and we figure out
where the device is being kept.

486
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,766
Oliver...I did mention

487
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:18,968
that the mainframe
is located inside

488
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,520
Merlyn Global Group's
main headquarters,

489
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:22,271
on the 25th floor?

490
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:24,023
It's only accessible through
a restricted access elevator.

491
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:26,359
I know.

492
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,678
We're going
to have to break in.

493
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:44,412
Hi. Oliver Queen.

494
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:47,081
I have an 11:30
with Tommy Merlyn.

495
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:51,802
I have a super deluxe
big Belly Buster

496
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:55,473
for a Mr. Andrews.
I think he's in security.

497
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,558
He a good tipper?

498
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,927
You can go on up,
Mr. Queen.

499
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,546
You can wait a second.

500
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,098
New guy,
you order food?

501
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,983
Yeah, I'm addicted
to big belly burger.

502
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:07,435
Never had it.

503
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:09,487
I'll split it with you.

504
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:13,524
Keep the change.

505
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,252
Hold that.

506
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:29,673
Where you heading,
sweetie?

507
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:30,925
19th floor.

508
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,460
Too bad,
I'm going to 13.

509
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:34,962
Damn it!

510
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:41,101
Mr. Andrews
got his lunch?

511
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:44,555
One belly buster with benzodiazepine.
Hold the mayo.

512
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:53,697
Sleep tight.

513
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:04,375
Mainframe's on 25, guys.
That's as close as I can get you.

514
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:18,222
Come on.

515
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:39,660
Don't look down.

516
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:41,144
Too late.

517
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:43,364
I should mention,
I'm afraid of heights,

518
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:44,915
which I just
learned.

519
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,084
Hey, Felicity.
Hmm?

520
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:48,786
Hold on to me tight.

521
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:52,172
I imagined you saying that under
different circumstances.

522
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:55,459
Very platonic...
circumstances.

523
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:02,433
Ready?
Uh-huh.

524
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:24,154
Come on.

525
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:28,125
You all right?

526
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,410
I'm fine.

527
00:26:29,412 --> 00:26:31,962
Yeah, this is just
my "about to hack" face.

528
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:34,248
I always...
Oh, look like this

529
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,467
right before I,
you know, hack.

530
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,218
Security patrol's on
a ten minute cycle.

531
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,588
I'll have my meeting with Tommy
and be back in nine, ok?

532
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,973
Ok.

533
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:44,675
Ok.

534
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:48,979
Dig, you got
eyes on her?

535
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:50,848
Five by five.

536
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:13,504
Ok.

537
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:17,925
Sure beats
the back of a bar.

538
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,593
I saw your name
in my schedule,

539
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:21,011
I thought it must
be a typo.

540
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:23,964
Why so serious?
Did someone decide

541
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:26,417
that they didn't want you putting
an arrow in them today?

542
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:28,953
I thought it was
past time we talked.

543
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,304
About what?

544
00:27:30,306 --> 00:27:32,690
Me leaving the club,
you being a serial killer?

545
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,591
We're not lacking
for topics.

546
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:37,945
Let's start with Laurel,
since you're still in love with her.

547
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,480
So are you.

548
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:42,783
I can't be with her, Tommy.

549
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:44,118
You know why I can't.

550
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,153
So what?

551
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:48,405
I'm her consolation
prize? I'll pass.

552
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:51,375
She's not anyone's...property.

553
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:54,628
Laurel makes
her own decisions.

554
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,665
And she chose you.

555
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:00,317
Until you couldn't handle it.

556
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,171
Lord knows I am guilty
of a lot of things between us,

557
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:07,758
but not you and her.

558
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,894
That's all I came to say.

559
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:21,321
What exactly do you do here?

560
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,908
I work closely
with my father.

561
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:40,791
Guys, you got trouble.
What?!

562
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:43,093
Felicity's about to have some head
of schedule company.

563
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:44,678
I'm not there yet
on the download.

564
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,097
Hold tight,
I'm on my way.

565
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:48,882
Oliver.

566
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:50,718
Mr. Merlyn.

567
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,170
I must say, I'm surprised
to see you here.

568
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:55,222
Tommy and I just had
a little unfinished business.

569
00:28:55,224 --> 00:28:57,174
Ahh. I know things have been
challenging between you two,

570
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:59,342
but I trust you're
working things out.

571
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:01,145
- Felicity!
- Just a few more seconds.

572
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,563
Yes.

573
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:04,181
I'm sorry, I have to go.

574
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:05,899
There are some investors
waiting for me back at the club.

575
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:07,401
I'm heading out
to a meeting myself.

576
00:29:07,403 --> 00:29:09,536
I'll walk you down
to the lobby.

577
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:12,956
She's going
to get made, Oliver.

578
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:16,376
Oliver, did you hear me?!

579
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,082
Felicity!

580
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,950
What? Just a few
more seconds!

581
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:28,985
Come on, come on, come on.

582
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:32,088
You don't have
a few more seconds.

583
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:35,742
Yes! Wow,
I really do do that.

584
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,500
Damn it, Oliver, she's in trouble,
where are you?

585
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:46,085
This is
a restricted area.

586
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:48,772
Let's see some I.D.

587
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:50,390
I.D.? Um...

588
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:52,442
Tell your mother
I said hello.

589
00:29:52,444 --> 00:29:54,711
I will.

590
00:29:54,713 --> 00:29:57,647
Got held up.
Heading back upstairs.

591
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:59,149
Ollie?

592
00:29:59,984 --> 00:30:02,402
Thea?

593
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:03,903
What are you
doing here?

594
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:06,072
I, uh, just saw Tommy.

595
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:07,740
Yeah, me, too.

596
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:09,358
I'm going to run back up,
I don't want to be late.

597
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,328
Oh, I thought
you just came down.

598
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,497
There you are!

599
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:16,916
Thanks a lot, man,
this one snuck past security.

600
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:18,384
One of Merlyn junior's
bimbos.

601
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:20,053
She's pissed he never
called her back.

602
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:22,255
Copy that.
I read the tabloids.

603
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:24,390
Yeah. Thanks again.
Let's go, Barbie.

604
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:26,426
Your new last name
ain't going to be Merlyn.

605
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:28,728
But I love him!
He's my man!

606
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,015
You're my knight
in shining armor.

607
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:37,070
Is that
your friend Roy?

608
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:39,155
No, um...
No?

609
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:41,224
Yeah, he gave me a ride.

610
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:43,910
Thea, what are you
really doing here?

611
00:30:43,912 --> 00:30:45,561
The truth, please.

612
00:30:45,563 --> 00:30:47,363
The truth?
Mm-hmm.

613
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:50,041
Um...We're trying to find
the Vigilante.

614
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:50,568
What?

615
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:53,088
Roy's been kind of obsessed
with him since he saved

616
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:54,121
his life at the subway.

617
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:56,289
And I overheard
Detective Lance saying

618
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:59,242
that the other archer was connected
to Merlyn Global, so--

619
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:01,761
Hey!
Roy.

620
00:31:01,763 --> 00:31:04,097
We haven't met. I'm Thea's
disapproving older brother.

621
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:06,766
Yeah, I know.
Good to meet you.

622
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:10,603
Don't mess around
with the Hood.

623
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:12,105
He's a psychopath,
he's dangerous,

624
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:14,140
and anyone who gets near him
winds up dead.

625
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:16,226
That will not be my sister.
Do you hear me?

626
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,482
Ok.

627
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:25,235
Take her home...now.

628
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:36,579
What are you doing?

629
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:38,631
The Vigilante's not too fond
of guys who sell Vertigo.

630
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:41,634
I know a guy who claims he still
has a stash to sell.

631
00:31:41,636 --> 00:31:43,452
Maybe we could
stake him out,

632
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:44,804
hope the Hood
shows up for him.

633
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:46,973
Did you not hear
what my brother said?

634
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:48,591
What does your brother
know about him?

635
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:51,844
Uh, for one thing, the Vigilante
once saved his life,

636
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:55,148
so if he's telling us to keep away,
that should say something.

637
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,183
No offense, Thea, but your
brother's kind of a wimp.

638
00:31:57,185 --> 00:32:00,603
Don't say that.
Why not? It's true.

639
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:03,907
My brother survived
five years alone on an island!

640
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:06,475
Five years I thought
I had lost him.

641
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:09,279
Yeah? Well, I lost
someone, too.

642
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:11,781
And they aren't coming back.

643
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:13,283
Who?

644
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:15,702
It doesn't matter.

645
00:32:15,704 --> 00:32:17,921
That is why I need to find him.

646
00:32:17,923 --> 00:32:20,173
So he can teach me
to be like him.

647
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:23,092
I'm not losing
anyone else ever again.

648
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:27,046
I can't do this, Roy.

649
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:29,048
If you don't give this up,

650
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,350
you're going to lose me.

651
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:33,186
Better now
than later.

652
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:45,865
Oh, good.

653
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,450
I was just coming
to check on you

654
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:50,620
to see if maybe
you'd like some tea, or...

655
00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:53,256
What is this?

656
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:58,044
Walter...

657
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:00,380
Please.

658
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:03,216
Divorce is an extreme reaction.

659
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:04,751
Well, considering
the circumstances,

660
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:06,535
I find it
somewhat reserved.

661
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:07,720
Or do you think
I believe that

662
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:09,472
my abduction
on the night you told me

663
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:12,258
that I was getting too close
to your conspiracy

664
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,310
was a coincidence.

665
00:33:14,312 --> 00:33:16,429
You--you were in danger.

666
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:19,098
This arrangement,
it saved your life.

667
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,933
Well,
that's ironic.

668
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:23,936
Because it feels like
you've destroyed it.

669
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,405
Walter...

670
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,407
You know, I read about
people in forced captivity.

671
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,826
Some of them said
it was a simple thought

672
00:33:29,828 --> 00:33:32,578
that got them through
the isolation and fear--

673
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,532
returning
to their loved ones.

674
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:39,235
So I don't know
really why I'm still alive, Moira,

675
00:33:39,237 --> 00:33:41,204
because I didn't
have that.

676
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:42,455
Walter, please...

677
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:44,073
What do you think
you can say to me

678
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:47,460
to convince me that
everything I knew, my whole life...

679
00:33:47,462 --> 00:33:49,645
hasn't just evaporated?

680
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,388
Where are you going?

681
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,890
Come here.

682
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:18,458
Detective?

683
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,293
What'd you find?

684
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:23,329
Merlyn Global's cyber security
is off the charts.

685
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:25,882
Firewalls, NSA-grade
I.P.Sec protocols...

686
00:34:25,884 --> 00:34:28,718
What's that, tech speak
for "I struck out, boss."

687
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,603
Yeah, but I wasn't
the only one.

688
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:33,339
Somebody else tried hacking into
Merlyn Global systems.

689
00:34:33,341 --> 00:34:36,642
Same pathways I used,
same result.

690
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:38,261
You're saying that someone
else was looking

691
00:34:38,263 --> 00:34:40,096
for Merlyn's connection
to Unidac?

692
00:34:40,098 --> 00:34:41,187
Yeah, someone good.

693
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,900
Knew how to reverse
engineer her footprints.

694
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:44,851
I almost didn't catch her.
Her?

695
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:46,686
Yeah. She works
at Queen Consolidated.

696
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:49,388
Name's Felicity Smoak.

697
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:53,076
Who the hell
is Felicity Smoak?

698
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:55,311
In addition to the download,
I also took the liberty

699
00:34:55,313 --> 00:34:57,313
of uploading a trojan
to Merlyn's system.

700
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:59,615
Figured it might
come in handy.

701
00:34:59,617 --> 00:35:01,367
That's smart. If Merlyn thinks
he's been compromised,

702
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,252
it'll help
if we know first.

703
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:05,004
Can you locate
the seismic device?

704
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:06,672
I'm working on it.

705
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:09,092
But there's at least a terraflop
of data to go through.

706
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:15,381
You all right?

707
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:18,301
My father, he told me
that he failed the city.

708
00:35:18,303 --> 00:35:20,843
Asked me to right his
wrongs, but I never knew

709
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,806
what he meant until now.

710
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:25,358
It's the Undertaking.

711
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,694
I promised myself that when
I crossed all these names

712
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:31,531
off the list,
I'd be done, but...

713
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:35,701
Taking down these people,
it doesn't honor him.

714
00:35:35,703 --> 00:35:40,072
I was just treating the symptoms
while the disease festered.

715
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:43,242
I stop the Undertaking...

716
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:46,579
I wipe out the disease.

717
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:49,999
What are you saying, Oliver?
You would hang up the Hood?

718
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:56,005
Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

719
00:35:57,925 --> 00:35:59,759
Where are you going?

720
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:02,311
Out.

721
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,566
Hi.

722
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:08,351
Can we talk?

723
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:12,822
Thank you.

724
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,512
What did you want
to talk about?

725
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:25,001
Wow, I thought this was going
to be easier to say.

726
00:36:25,003 --> 00:36:28,154
But now
I'm standing here...

727
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:30,673
Looking at you,
and it's--

728
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,508
Just say what you have
to say and go, ok?

729
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,244
Ever since I've been back,
we've been doing this dance.

730
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:39,348
We come together,
and then I pull away.

731
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,851
Something pulls me away.

732
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:45,521
But I think...

733
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:48,574
finally...

734
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:51,844
that something
might be over.

735
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:56,482
What are you trying to say?

736
00:36:56,484 --> 00:37:00,820
That...you know me
better than anyone.

737
00:37:00,822 --> 00:37:03,105
And that you...

738
00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:07,577
are more important to me
than anyone.

739
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:11,631
I just hope I didn't wait
too long to say it.

What is it?

755
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:25,709
Felicity found
the Markov device.

756
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:27,544
Merlyn's keeping it
at a warehouse

757
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:29,012
his company
owns in the Glades.

758
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:30,664
Good. Coordinate an attack.

759
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:33,000
You take the device,
I'll take Merlyn.

760
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:34,384
Got a location?

761
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:36,136
Yeah. According to
Felicity's trojan,

762
00:38:36,138 --> 00:38:38,672
Merlyn's logged on to his computer
from his office.

763
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:41,475
I'm on my way.

764
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:45,512
The uniform
suits you, Yao Fei.

765
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,800
Any time
you're ready.

766
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:53,187
To the people of China
and citizens of the world,

767
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:55,906
I make this statement
voluntarily,

768
00:38:55,908 --> 00:38:57,941
taking responsibility
for the shooting

769
00:38:57,943 --> 00:39:00,527
of Ferris Air flight 637

770
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:04,248
to protest the People's
Republic of China's treatment of me;

771
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,250
for betraying
and abandoning me

772
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:08,418
to the island of Lian Yu.

773
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:14,208
Consider this my righteous
delivery of powerful vengeance.

774
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,009
Thank you.

775
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:20,848
No!
Ba!

776
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,800
Ba!
Sir.

777
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:24,384
Plane is within range.

778
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,253
Very well.

779
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:01,171
I'll be in touch.

780
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:03,674
Can I help you?

781
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:05,909
No...

782
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:08,145
I wasn't
talking to you.

783
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:13,317
Malcolm Merlyn...

784
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:16,787
You have failed this city.

785
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,288
And how have I
done that?

786
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,740
The Undertaking.

787
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:21,909
It ends now.

788
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:23,243
Oliver, the device...

789
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:26,496
It's gone.

790
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:30,017
Where's the device?

791
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,919
Safe.

792
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:34,254
I don't know how you got
that trojan onto my system,

793
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:37,624
but it prompted me
to take precautions.

794
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:41,845
There is nothing you can do to stop
what is about to happen.

795
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:44,348
And you shouldn't.

796
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,267
This city needs
what is about to happen

797
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:48,919
in order to survive.

798
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:51,254
The people who are
destroying it from the inside

799
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:53,724
need to be erased
from the map.

800
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:55,509
Fine.

801
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:57,895
Let's start with you.

802
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:02,182
Ironic, isn't it?

803
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:05,135
Last Christmas,
I almost killed you.

804
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:08,322
A few months ago,
you saved my life.

805
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,273
And now you're here
trying to kill me.

806
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:13,293
You should
make up your mind.

807
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:15,078
Done.

808
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:56,286
Oh, no.
