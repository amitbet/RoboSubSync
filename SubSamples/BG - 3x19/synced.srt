00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,586
<i>(Roslin) The Cylons have established</i>
<i>a human police force.</i>

What's this?

6
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:21,068
This orders the executions
of all the detainees on the next page.

7
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:23,465
- It requires your signature.
<i>- (gun cocks)</i>

8

<i>(gunfire)</i>

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,346
The Cylons knew where we were gonna be.

11
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:40,947
- l want to explain.
- She sold us out.

12
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:45,346
You know what has to be done here. It
would be better for her sake if it was you.

<i>(sobs)</i>

14
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:50,307
You're not afraid to represent
the most hated man alive?

15
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:54,105
l'd like to see my client.
If they wanna kill me, they'll find a way.

16
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:54,955
No!

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,388
<i>(Adama) Baltar's defence will need help.</i>

18
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:01,785
Dad, why not me? l'm close to the case.
l've read the documents.

19
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:04,148
You're a CAG.
You're not a lawyer.

20
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:07,146
l will not allow you
to sit across the courtroom,

21
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:09,950
on the other side,
defending Gaius Baltar.

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,385
- Is that an order?
- l'm through giving you orders.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
<i>(child laughs)</i>

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,870
Hera!

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,547
<i>We got Greenleaf s FTL nailed down.</i>
So fleet's ready to jump again.

27
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,828
How many more before we find the nebula?

28
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,348
l'm estimating an even dozen.
We're getting close.

29
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,947
Still no sign of the Cylons.

30
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:45,670
No. We've left a trailing bird
at every jump site.

31
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,385
No DRADIS contacts,
no sightings, nothing.

32
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,944
Alter the orders of the trailing Raptor.

33
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:55,745
Tell them to remain six hours
before catching up with the fleet.

34
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:57,064
<i>(Gaeta) Yes, sir.</i>

35
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:59,164

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,586
<i>(Skulls) Yeah!</i>

00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,036
Whoo-hoo!

38
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:17,307
You're up, superstar.

39
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:20,349
You know this game has frak all
to do with the real thing?

40
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:23,229
<i>(Skulls) l didn't hear you</i>
say that in the beginning.

41
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,949
<i>(static continues)...</i>

<i>- (Seelix) Had what?</i>

44
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:44,706
That song.
You don't hear that song?

45
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:47,526
No. Come on.
You're up. Let's go.

46
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,628
Baltar was instrumental
in the Cylon attack on the Colonies.

48
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:58,307
The president wants him
charged with genocide.

49
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:01,626
l can't make it stick.
There's no evidence of his involvement.

50
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:07,745
The president saw him with one of
the Sixes on Caprica. Before the attacks.

51
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:12,348
You want me to put Roslin on the stand
to testify about her drug-induced visions?

52
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,426
What we want is for you to do your job
and convict him.

53
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,788
If you can't,
we'll find someone who will.

54
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:21,468
This is a courtesy meeting,
not a strategy session.

55
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:23,828
l am charging Baltar with what l can prove.

56
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:28,146
l do serve at the pleasure of the president
<i>and if she decides to replace me...</i>

57
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:32,466
l'm sure there are other lawyers
willing to take up the case.

58
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,201
If there are any other lawyers.

59
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,860
Dr Baltar?

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,596
Who are you?

61
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,270
Oh.

62
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:04,345
l'm under instructions from my attorney
not to speak to any members of the press.

63
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:09,878
Oh. No, Dr Baltar,
I... l want you to look at this picture.

64
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,270
This is my son. He's sick
and l want you to bless him.

65
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,370
Bless him?

66
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,627
- Guard! l'm terribly sorry, madam.
- Please.

67
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:29,069
l can't help you. l'm not God, the God,
or a god of any derivation thereof.

68
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,066
- Please. I...
- Sorry. l don't have any special powers.

69
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,987
- l believe in you. Just please take it.
- Well, that's very flattering.

70
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:41,025
- Please, will you just take it? Please.
- l'm on trial for my life. l need privacy.

71
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,185
- Please.
- l'll do my best.

72
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:47,365
- You can save him.
- Yeah. Mind how you go, now.

73
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,467
How many is that now?

74
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:08,242
Five. Not including the 30 or 40
who've written letters.

75
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,148
Well, l suppose it can't be helped.

76
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:19,386
Celebrity trials invariably
bring out the crazies.

77
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,869
So, you think they're crazy?

78
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,353
You see, l saw a woman in pain.

79
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,746
l saw a woman who can see you
more clearly than you can see yourself.

80
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:36,351
Even if they kill you,
your name will live on forever.

81
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,908
<i>(Racetrack) Galactica, Raptor 289. We're</i>
<i>clear and in position for rearguard picket.</i>

82
00:06:57,008 --> 00:07:00,820
<i>(Tigh) Roger, 289.</i>
<i>Have fun watching our ass, Racetrack.</i>

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,490
Have fun watching Baltar's ass get nailed.

84
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,905
All right, get comfortable.
12 hours and counting.

85
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:26,268
12 hours hanging out here
like bait on a hook...

86
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:29,149
waiting to see if the Cylons
are still following us.

87
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,834
Just shut up and deal, OK?

88
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,315
How do we measure loss?

89
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,555
How do we measure loss?

90
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,987
We measure it in the faces of the dead.

91
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:59,167
The faces that haunt our memories
and our dreams.

92
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,995
How do we measure loss?

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,350
We measure it in our own faces,

94
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,904
the ones we see in the mirror every day,

95
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:15,710
because it has marked each of us.

96
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,185
So, how do we measure loss?

97
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:24,065
When the scale of it becomes too hard
to absorb any other way,

98
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:25,986
we use numbers.

99
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:30,828
How many killed. How many maimed.
How many missing.

100
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,949
And when those numbers
become too vast to comprehend,

101
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,750
as they did two years ago,

102
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,035
we had to turn it around.

103
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,027
We began to count the living,

104
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:48,482
those of us who survived
to continue the saga of the human race.

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,530
44,035 -...

106
00:08:57,408 --> 00:09:02,148
the sum total of survivors from the Twelve
Colonies who settled on New Caprica...

107
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:07,234
with President Gaius Baltar
as their leader and protector.

108
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,010
38,838 -...

109
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,712
our number the day after we escaped.

110
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,107
And the missing number?

111
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:24,192
The one that no one wants to face?

112
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,780
5,197.

113
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,290
5,197 of us killed,

114
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:47,957
left behind, or simply disappeared.

115
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,954
5,197 of all that remains
of the human race...

116
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,990
lost.

117
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,188
<i>The citizens of the Twelve Colonies...</i>

118
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:06,788
<i>entrusted their fate and their lives</i>
<i>to Gaius Baltar.</i>

119
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,430
<i>What we received was a reign of terror...</i>

120
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,985
<i>that staggers our minds</i>
<i>and breaks our hearts.</i>

121
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:16,066
<i>Instead of governance,</i>
<i>we got tyranny.</i>

122
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,949
<i>Instead ofjustice,</i>
<i>we got oppression.</i>

123
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:22,505
<i>Instead of a president,</i>
<i>we got a murderer.</i>

124
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:27,071
<i>Today, humanity holds him</i>
<i>accountable for his crime.</i>

125
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,904
Gaius Baltar is not a victim.

126
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,667
Gaius Baltar chose to
side with the Cylons...

127
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:41,508
and to actively seek the deaths
of his fellow citizens.

128
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,958
For that,

129
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:46,321
he must pay the ultimate price.

130
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,780
Your Honours, the defence would like
to change our plea to guilty.

131
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,707
What? Counsellor,
are you sure you want to do that?

132
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:09,105
No. But what choice do l have?

133
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:12,947
l mean, it's obvious my client is guilty.

134
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,586
He's a traitor, a killer. He's no better than
a Cylon, and what do we do with them?

135
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:22,704
<i>- (man) Throw 'em out the airlock!</i>
- That's right. Throw 'em out the airlock.

136
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:26,388
This man sold us to our enemy.

137
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:29,227
<i>This man is our enemy.</i>

138
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:33,786
And if there's one thing that's good
in war, that is right and just and proper,

139
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:36,266
it's slaughtering our enemy!

140
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,792
Getting some righteous payback!

141
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,990
What are we waiting for?!

142
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,275
Let's just kill him now!

143
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,469
It'd be easier, wouldn't it?

144
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
Simpler.

145
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:02,070
Justice of the mob.

146
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,355
It's what they want.

147
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Especially her.

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,305
She's been wanting this
for over a year now.

149
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:20,186
Ever since he beat her
in a free and fair election of the people.

150
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:23,027
Now she gets the chance
to exact her revenge...

151
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:28,267
upon a man whose only real crime
is bowing to the inevitable.

152
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:33,188
Gaius Baltar saved the lives
of the people on New Caprica...

153
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:36,585
where Laura Roslin
would have seen us all dead,

154
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:42,118
victims of a battle
we had no hope in winning.

155
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,865
l don't know about you,
but l'm glad she wasn't the president...

156
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:53,431
when the Cylons arrived
and said, "Surrender or die."

157
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,875
l owe my life to Gaius Baltar
and the decision he made that day.

158
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,395
And so does Laura Roslin.

159
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,468
- Yeah, like you'd frakking know.
- l know you wank it in your rack,

160
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:21,109
ladies' man.

161
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,269
You see, that's called self-healing.

162
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,954
- OK. Time check.
<i>- (beeping)</i>

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,636
Oh, we got something.
Lots of company.

164
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,065
Reading five baseships.
Crap! They're right on top of us.

165
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:40,705
- Frak. Frak! Incoming!
- The FTL's still spinning up.

166
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:44,190
We gotta jump.
Now, godsdammit! Now!

167
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,266
Search the entire fleet for tracking devices.

168
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:08,891
It's possible they could have placed one
on a ship on New Caprica.

169
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,065
l think that we should ask the Six.
She may be willing to help.

170
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:15,587
Baltar's girlfriend?
Why would she do that?

171
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:19,348
Because she does not want to see Hera
go back to the Cylons.

172
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:23,746
You think that thing would stick
her neck out for some half-Cylon whelp?

173
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:26,709
l have a feeling
she'd lay her life down for her.

174
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:28,809
A feeling?

175
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,949
It's more than a feeling, all right?
Just do it!

176
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,235
It doesn't hurt to ask.

177
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,270
No.

178
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,864
Ask the prisoner if it knows
of any tracking devices in the fleet.

179
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:49,964
With pleasure.

180
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,625
The president,
gods bless her sunny, optimistic soul,

181
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:35,866
thinks you might wanna share
how your buddies have been tracking us.

182
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:40,641
So l'm here to ask the question
and listen to your lies.

183
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,685
In the last battle, we discovered your
fuel ship had a unique radiation signature.

184
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,956
They must have found a way to track it.

185
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,987
What else do you know?

186
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:07,307
What other secrets are rattling around
inside that mechanical brain?

187
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:09,789
Don't be intimidated by him.

188
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,868
He's just using you
to exorcise his own pain.

189
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,388
Poor old sod.

190
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:22,466
He lost someone close to him.

191
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,828
You know how that feels, don't you?

192
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:30,705
l know a lot of things.
You wanna know one thing l know?

193
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:33,075
l know about your loss.

194
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,425
It hurts, doesn't it?

195
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,840
You wonder how you can even survive it.

196
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,625
l don't know what you're talking about,
but it's not gonna work.

197
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:50,020
<i>(Baltar) She was his world.</i>

198
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,626
Of course, he only realised
when she was gone.

199
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,726
Did she know?

200
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,830
Did she know?

201
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:02,945
Did she know how much
she meant to you?

202
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:06,585
Or did you wait to tell her
until she was gone?

203
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:07,435
What?

204
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,987
But you made her think
that she was a burden.

205
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,552
A millstone around your neck.

206
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,380
But then, you humans always destroy
the ones who love you, don't you?

207
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,549
Shackle this thing.

208
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
<i>(lawyer) Colonel Tigh?</i>

209
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,950
Colonel Tigh?

210
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,387
Excuse me.
What was the question, again?

211
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:04,068
As the leader of the insurgency,
did you ever hear of an instance...

212
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:07,465
when Baltar stood up to the Cylons
or tried to disrupt their plans?

213
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:11,900
Oh, no, never.
He never lifted a frakking finger to help us.

214
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,145
Ellen did more.

215
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:17,748
At least she was trying to...
<i>(slurs words) to help us.</i>

216
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,035
My gods, he's drunk.

217
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,030
Yes.

218
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,194
Yes, Ellen. Your wife.

219
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,785
Another victim of Baltar's Cylon allies.

220
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:35,265
Yeah, that's right.

221
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,115
Yeah.

222
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Thank you, Colonel.

223
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,547
Your witness.

224
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:48,467
- What happened to his wife?
- She worked for a Cylon administrator.

225
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:51,024
Worked for him?
You know what happened to her?

226
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:56,394
No. No idea. l presume she died
in the exodus from New Caprica.

227
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
- Colonel?
- Hm.

228
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,586
You dislike Gaius Baltar because
you consider him to be a traitor. Correct?

229
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:13,230
And a coward and a mass murderer.

230
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,344
The suicide bombing
of the police graduation.

231
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:20,904
Baltar was the intended target,
was he not?

232
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:24,348
If he'd had the guts to show up that day
like he was supposed to,

233
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:27,309
you and l wouldn't be having
this conversation now.

234
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:32,308
So you ordered the killing of -
what was it? - 33 other men and women...

235
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:36,068
just for the chance to kill Gaius Baltar.

236
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:40,626
They were all traitors -
anyone who put on that uniform.

237
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:44,679
But, yes. He was the target.

238
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,906
What happened to your wife?

239
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:54,987
- Exception. Relevance?
- The door was opened on direct.

240
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:58,306
- l fail to see the point of pursuing...
- He's right, Admiral.

241
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:02,350
If it was brought up during direct
examination, it can be pursued in cross.

242
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,590
Overruled. Continue.

243
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,385
- What happened to your wife, Colonel?
- You frakking son of a bitch.

244
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:13,025
Isn't it true that she collaborated
openly with the Cylons?

245
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,185
That she actually worked for them?

246
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:17,867
She was faking it.

247
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,909
Making them think
that she was working for them.

248
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,146
l-I see. And Baltar,
he wasn't faking it. No?

249
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:26,066
That's right.

250
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,587
And you blame him for her death.

251
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,917
Have you been drinking today, Colonel?

252
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,236
l had a drink.
l haven't been drinking.

253
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,745
- You liked to drink with Ellen, l imagine.

What the hell is he talking about?

258
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,320
Gaius Baltar didn't order
the death of your wife.

259
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,552
Colonel, that was somebody else.

260
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Who was it, Colonel?

261
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Who killed Ellen?

262
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,947
Come on, Colonel.
We're waiting. Tell us.

263
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:30,589
Who was it?
Who killed Ellen?

264
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,100
l did.

265
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,420
l did.

266
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,780
l did.

267
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,225
She was giving information to the Cylons.

268
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:53,850
A lot of good men died.
She was my wife, it was my responsibility.

269
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,426
She did it for me.
That's what she said.

270
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:03,066
To save me from going back to prison
so they could tear more pieces off me.

271
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,355
So l killed her.

272
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,305
All because of that thing over there.

273
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,748
All because Gaius frakking Baltar didn't
have the guts to stand up to the Cylons.

274
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:20,747
Because he handed our fates
over to the Cylons,

275
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:23,229
l had to kill my Ellen.

276
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,269
So Gaius Baltar made you kill your wife.

277
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,346
That's why you hate him,

278
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:36,905
and that's why you'd say anything
to see him die.

279
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:39,550
You're godsdamn right, l would.

280
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,865
l would do anything,

281
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:43,915
say anything,

282
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:47,787
to see that man die a painful death.

283
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
No further questions.

296
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,508
l was grading papers in the schoolhouse
that night and they came again.

297
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:54,948
Fortunately, the children were gone.
It was after dark.

298
00:23:55,048 --> 00:24:01,028
They took close to 200 of our people
that night, under Baltar's direct orders.

299
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:07,503
As it turned out, all of our names
were on a death list signed by Dr Baltar.

300
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,146
Let us be crystal clear on this fact.

301
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:15,748
You are saying that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,

302
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:19,790
ordered your execution
and the execution of 200 other people?

303
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,476
Yes. Indeed.
That's exactly what l'm saying.

304
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,790
We need to talk.

305
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,905
<i>(Baltar) We need to find something</i>
to discredit her testimony.

306
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:38,110
She's a fanatic, right?
And l don't know if that's gonna happen.

307
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,120
- You're awfully quiet.
- l was just listening.

308
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,748
You see, your problem is is that
l'm a really good liar and you're not.

309
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:51,673
- So let's have it.
- Have what?

310
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,666
He's right. You do know something. You
know something and you're not saying.

311
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:59,666
- It's probably not true.
- l like it.

312
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:02,108
l doubt she would say anything
in front of me.

313
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,309
She? She? This is about Laura Roslin?
And you're not tell... Tell me!

314
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:07,609
Shut up.

315
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,906
Enjoying yourself so far, huh?

316
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:18,428
Having a good time sticking it to
the old man, defending a hated man?

317
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:22,550
- That's not why l agreed to do this.
- You just decided to stand up for justice...

318
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,706
and those other things
we inscribe upon courtroom doors?

319
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:30,665
Yeah. That's exactly what l'm doing,
because l believe in the system.

320
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:35,348
l really believe. l even believe
that our lowlife pond scum of a client...

321
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:38,557
actually deserves a fair trial.

322
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,748
The system requires
that you tell what you know,

323
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:46,108
which leaves you with
one of two uncomfortable options.

324
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,947
First, share the information,
and in so doing,

325
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,149
uphold the very principles
that you claim to hold so dear.

326
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:55,306
Or second, keep 'em to yourself...

327
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:58,189
and prove once and for all
your only purpose here...

328
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:02,064
is to jab your father in the eye and make
a mockery of the justice system.

329
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:04,029
Very, very nice.

330
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,425
But l know why l'm here. l don't need
to prove it to you or to anyone.

331
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:12,188
You're wrong. You need to prove it
to yourself. Or you'll leave that courtroom...

332
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:18,268
knowing you kept a secret that could
have saved that man's miserable life.

333
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,149
Unless l misjudge you,

334
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:25,340
that's not something that Lee Adama
wishes on his conscience.

335
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,468
So, what'll it be, Major?

336
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:30,908
Sit on the sidelines mouthing pieties,

337
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:36,703
or are you gonna get in this trial
and give us something we can use?

338
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,667
There we go. We made it.

339
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,767
- Come on.
<i>- (groans)</i>

340
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,348
There we go. Come on.

341
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:53,593
- Come on. There we go.
<i>- Oh. (coughs)</i>

342
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,628
There we go.

343
00:26:57,728 --> 00:27:02,867
<i>(mumbles) You've had enough of that.</i>
l know. l know.

344
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,510
- l'm all right.
- Attaboy.

345
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,586
Got some good news today.

346
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:12,146
We found the radiation signature
on the tylium ship...

347
00:27:12,246 --> 00:27:14,385
like the Cylon prisoner said we would.

348
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:17,335
Good. That's great.

349
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:22,147
It's being repaired as we speak.

350
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:27,510
Mr Gaeta estimates the fleet's
nine jumps away from the nebula.

351
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,225
Considering how long
it's gonna take to fix the tylium ship,

352
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,914
we're out maybe three days.

353
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,305
Three days out...

354
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:42,393
from the next clue on the road to Earth.

355
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,714
l can't smell her.

356
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,586
l can't smell her any more, Bill.

357
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:53,875
l kept her clothes...

358
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,970
but her smell is gone now.

359
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
<i>(sighs)...</i>

360
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,149
l gotta go, Saul.
l'm really tired.

361
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:10,734
l'm really sorry about all that in court.

362
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,335
- There's nothing to be sorry about.
- l embarrassed you. Made you look bad.

363
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,314
You're my oldest friend, Saul.

364
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,635
You never embarrass me.

365
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Get some rest.

366
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,349
Can the former CAG make
a radical suggestion to the admiral?

367
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:42,708
What if we don't fix the tylium ship?

368
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:46,909
- Repairs have already started.
- l realise that, but hear me out.

369
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:51,466
We're too close to the nebula to hope
the Cylons can't guess where we're going.

370
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:57,388
So if we don't fix it, if we send the ship off
on a new course with a couple of Raptors,

371
00:28:57,488 --> 00:29:01,706
let her make a few jumps before rejoining
the fleet, it might throw the Cylons off.

372
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,467
It's a good idea.

373
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:09,350
l'll take it into consideration.
Is there anything else?

374
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,184
- How's the president?
- What?

375
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:20,129
Is she OK? She looked
a little rattled in court yesterday.

376
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
<i>(sighs)</i>

377
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,467
We can't talk about the trial outside
of court. You know that, or you should.

378
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:34,509
l know. l wasn't asking...

379
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:40,189
After what you did to Tigh, you're the last
person l would consider to confide in.

380
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:43,665
Me? l didn't do anything to Tigh.

381
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:46,427
He was drunk.
That's really not my fault.

382
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:50,028
You told Lampkin about Ellen.

383
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:53,266
l didn't even know about Ellen.

384
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:55,149
Yeah, right.

385
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,146
Are you calling me a liar?

386
00:29:57,246 --> 00:29:59,870
l'm calling you a liar and a coward,

387
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,750
one who doesn't have the guts
to go after a man himself.

388
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,785
Instead, you hand the shiv to a stranger...

389
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:13,620
and let him stab Tigh in the back.

390
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,546
And for what?

391
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:19,424
The traitorous piece of garbage
Gaius Baltar...

392
00:30:19,524 --> 00:30:22,329
who doesn't even deserve a trial.

393
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Are you done?

394
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,350
Yes.

395
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,555
Then so am I.

396
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,475
l will not serve under a man
who questions my integrity.

397
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,525
And l won't have an officer under
my command who doesn't have any.

398
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,715
l'll see you in court, Admiral.

399
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,790
- Let me do this.
<i>- (Baltar) What?</i>

400
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,068
Are you sure, Major?

401
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,865
It's "Mr" now.
And yeah, l'm sure. It should be me.

402
00:31:46,965 --> 00:31:53,765
- You're not gonna let my security guard...
<i>- (Franks) We're waiting, Mr Lampkin.</i>

403
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,665
If it please the court, my associate
Mr Adama will question the witness.

404
00:31:59,765 --> 00:32:02,145
His associate.

405
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:06,325
- The defence may proceed.
<i>- (Lampkin) Thank you.</i>

406
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,509
Aren't you alive today
because of Gaius Baltar?

407
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:28,389
l'm alive today because the insurgents
managed to stop the execution.

408
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,065
They saved you from a Cylon firing squad,

409
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:36,988
but wasn't it Baltar who saved your life
when you were dying from cancer?

410
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,588
Relevance?

411
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,867
Um... Your Honours...

412
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:44,908
Hostile witness, Your Honours.

413
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:48,668
If the court would grant us
just a little latitude...

414
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:50,768
We'll allow it.

415
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Thank you. Um...

416
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,388
Did Gaius Baltar save your life
when you were dying from cancer?

417
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:03,068
Dr Baltar's scientific knowledge
did save my life, indeed.

418
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:06,705
Can you be more specific? How did
he save your life on that occasion?

419
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:12,079
He injected me with the blood
of a half-Cylon, half-human baby.

420
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,545
And your cancer vanished?

421
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,645
Completely.

422
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,307
During your illness,
what sort of medication were you on?

423
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:25,030
l was taking a lot of
medications at the time...

424
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,275
and l don't remember all their names.

425
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,790
Did you take something
called chamalla extract?

426
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,510
Hm.

427
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:38,958
Yes.

428
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,507
Isn't it true that one of the side effects
of taking chamalla...

429
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:53,985
is a propensity
to experience hallucinations?

430
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:57,508
Yes, that is one of the possible
side effects of chamalla.

431
00:33:57,608 --> 00:33:59,905
And isn't it also true...

432
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:04,668
that the visions that you once described
as messages from the gods...

433
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,905
were actually the result...

434
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,986
of a pharmacological reaction
from taking chamalla?

435
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:13,827
The chamalla enabled me to see
things foretold by the scriptures,

436
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,986
things that will help this fleet
find its way to Earth.

437
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:19,986
- You of all people should know that.
- Your Honours?

438
00:34:20,086 --> 00:34:26,036
- Where are you going with this?
- Just one more question, Your Honour.

439
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,786
<i>(whispers) Please, don't do this.</i>

440
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:40,936
Please.

441
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,756
Madam President, are you taking
chamalla at this time?

442
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,980
"Captain Apollo." You remember that?

443
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,675
l always thought that had such a nice ring
to it. l am so, so sorry for you now.

444
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,989
Chamalla, Madam President.

445
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:13,907
Perhaps dissolved in your tea
to mask the bitterness.

446
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:16,427
Don't answer.
l'm putting a stop to this now.

447
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:19,469
If she is on drugs
it goes to her credibility as a witness.

448
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:21,146
Witness is dismissed.

449
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:25,024
Your Honours, l have to object.
He's trying to cover something up here.

450
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,627
One more word
and you'll be held for contempt.

451
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:30,866
- Admiral!
- l'd like to hear the witness answer.

452
00:35:30,966 --> 00:35:32,966
As would I.

453
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,839
Madam President,
are you taking chamalla again?

454
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,980
Yes, l am.

455
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,907
No further questions.

456
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:02,675
Mr Adama, aren't you going
to ask me why?

457
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,999
- l'm sorry?
- Why am l taking chamalla again?

458
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,495
- It's not strictly relevant.
- Perhaps not to you, but it is to me.

459
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,158
Go ahead. Ask me why.

460
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,075
Finish what you started.

461
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,196
Why are you taking the chamalla again,
Madam President?

462
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,195
l am taking chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.

463
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,905
The fact that she's having hallucinations
is relevant to Baltar's defence.

464
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:09,225
That's the way the system works, Dee.

465
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:13,626
The accused has a right to challenge
the credibility of witnesses against them.

466
00:37:13,726 --> 00:37:16,184
The system is broken, Lee.

467
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:20,187
The system elected that man to be
president and it's trying to let him walk.

468
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:23,506
That system doesn't deserve
to be defended, but taken apart...

469
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:25,989
and put back together again.

470
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,640
You know, l wish...

471
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,307
- l wish l could make you understand.
- l do understand, Lee.

472
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,595
That's why l'm leaving.

473
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,430
No, you don't.

474
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
You frakking don't.

475
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,628
How long have you known
about the cancer?

476
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,669
- About a week.
- And how advanced is the disease?

477
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:08,268
Will you be getting more transfusions
from the half-Cylon donor?

478
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:13,268
This is detail l'm not going into now. l'll let
you know when we have a game plan.

479
00:38:13,368 --> 00:38:16,469
How will the treatment
impact your duties as president?

480
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:19,945
- So far, it hasn't at all.
- Are you currently taking chamalla?

481
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:22,105
Don't answer that.

482
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:24,228
How often do you hallucinate?

483
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:27,386
- Enough of this crap. We're done here.
- Tory.

484
00:38:27,486 --> 00:38:31,626
- You can go pick over another carcass.
- Tory! Come here.

485
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,632
l'll see you inside. Thank you.

486
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,909
<i>(laughs) l'm sorry.</i>

487
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:44,625
Temperatures are running a little high
in the fleet these days.

488
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:47,068
Who's next? Karen?

489
00:38:47,168 --> 00:38:50,993
Madam President,
how long do you have to live?

490
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,957
How long do you have to live, Karen?

491
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,106
- You handled that well.
- You didn't.

492
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:12,905
"Pick over another carcass"? As opposed
to mine? That'll look good in the press.

493
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:15,385
I... l don't even know why l said that. I...

494
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:18,307
What is up with you?
You've been off your game for days.

495
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:22,147
You're distracted, exhausted.
Frankly, you're plain obnoxious.

496
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:24,704
l just haven't been sleeping very well.

497
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:28,308
You need to pull it together
and focus on your job fast,

498
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,987
or l can find someone
who can handle the press...

499
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:35,592
as well as pull a comb
through their hair once a week.

500
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,638
<i>(static/haunting music)...</i>

501
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,430
<i>- (Helo) Lieutenant?</i>
- Oh, morning, XO.

502
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,949
Morning. It's just temporary.

503
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:09,504
The colonel will pull it together.

504
00:40:09,604 --> 00:40:10,504
Right.

505
00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:15,587
We're using the tylium ship as a decoy
to lead the Cylons along this course,

506
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:17,506
almost directly opposite to ours.

507
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:21,507
When they reach this point here
they'll recalibrate their FTL...

508
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:26,268
and jump back to rendezvous with the rest
of the fleet here at the lonian Nebula.

509
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,628
Any indication the Cylons are following?

510
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:32,345
Nothing yet. It would appear
they've stopped following us as well.

511
00:40:32,445 --> 00:40:37,348
Our Raptors have yet to pick up any sign
of pursuit since the ship left the fleet.

512
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:39,904
How many jumps
until we reach the nebula?

513
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,108
Uh...

514
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:45,798
it's hard to believe,
but we're down to the last three.

515
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,270
Good.

516
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:52,227
Is there anything else, sir?

517
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:54,515
No. No, l was just, uh...

518
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,464
just remembering back on Caprica,
when the weather was about to change,

519
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:04,049
you'd... you'd get this smell in the air.

520
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,107
The sun could be out, not a cloud
in the sky, but you'd pick up this smell,

521
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:14,307
and you knew that, um...
something was just over the horizon.

522
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,747
Weather's changing, Felix.

523
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:22,229
We need to be ready for it.

524
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,555
There's a storm coming.

525
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
<i>(haunting music)</i>

526
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,555
It's in the ship.

527
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,917
It's in the frakking ship!

528
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,390
<i>- (talks gibberish)</i>
- He's doing it again.

529
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,490
- Thanks.
<i>- (laughs)</i>
