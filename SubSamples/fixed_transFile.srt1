, Pick up one of the stones
, Stand behind the rock
272
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:27,873
In a few minutes, the man in black
. Come around the bend
273
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:31,543
, As soon as you see the head
. Strike the stone
274
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:36,298
.'s My way is not fair
275
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:08,919
I did it on purpose

276
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:10,923
. I believe you
277
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:17,300
What happens now
. Shall fight in God, fairness -
278
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:21,596
., Without tricks, without arms
. Capability with the ability to
279
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:25,893
That is, let the stone
, And I'll let the sword
280
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,138
And kill each other
? Like civilized people
281
00:26:28,591 --> 00:26:30,092
. Dining kill you now
282
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:35,426
Frankly, I think
. Having you an edge in combat manual
283
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:40,679
What do I largest and strongest
. Everyone? I do not even practicing
284
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,621
, See
Do you play with me, or what

I want you to feel
, You are fine
286
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:08,456
. Embarrassed I do not want to die
287
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:14,505
. You're quick. - It is very good
Why did you wear a mask -
288
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:18,510
Acid burn, or something
. These? - No, it's just a convenient
289
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:20,772
I think everyone
. Surgical masks for the future
290
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,155
. Now understand why zapped me
291
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,786
Why do you think
Well ... -
292
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:38,166
Not long ago I fought
. Single person
293
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,669
. I specialize in groups
294
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:46,216
Fighting gangs
. Charity, things like
295
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:51,428
Why this should change something
296
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:55,474
, Jr.
Use certain movements
297
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,269
, Fighting against six people
298
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:04,776
Which is different from fighting
Against one person ...
299
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:22,961
, Head it hurt when she wakes up
... But now, rest well
300
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:25,548
. And dream of large women
301
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:47,278
. Was a great battle here
302
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:53,451
. Was widely
. Both experts
303
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:56,491
Who won? How it ends
304
00:28:56,949 --> 00:28:59,786
Loser ran off alone ...
305
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:06,875
Conductor followed footprints
. Those leading Gilder
306
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:11,296
? We follow both
. Loser not worth anything -
307
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,256
. Important only Princess
308
00:29:14,382 --> 00:29:16,969
Obviously warriors Gilder
. Responsible for the fact
309
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:19,512
We must prepare
. To what awaits below
310
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:21,761
Maybe this trap
311
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,304
I think that anything
Might be a trap ...
312
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,137
.'s Why I'm still alive
313
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:41,445
Well ...
. Stayed just you and me
314
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:47,492
If you want her to die
., Please, continue to approach
315
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,610
Let me explain ...
. Nothing to explain -
316
00:29:51,843 --> 00:29:54,679
You're trying to kidnap
. Stolen honestly what
317
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:57,765
Maybe we can reach an agreement
318
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,394
, There is no agreement
. And you bring death
319
00:30:04,732 --> 00:30:07,652
If there is no agreement
. We are at an impasse
320
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:11,488
I'm afraid so. I can not
, Physically fight you
321
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:16,492
. And can not compete with my mind
You're so smart ...? - I'll tell you -
322
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:19,745
, Heard of Plato
? Aristotle, Socrates
323
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:22,999
. Well. - Dummies
- Really?
324
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:28,292
. Then, we'll have a battle of wits
? The princess -
325
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:30,920
? To death
326
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:35,050
. I get. - Beautiful
. Pour the wine
327
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:53,192
, Smell It
., But do not touch
328
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,488
. I do not smell anything
, The stuff you do not smell -
329
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:59,407
. Called powder Aiokin
330
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:02,118
Has no smell or taste
, It dissolves in the liquid
331
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:04,746
And one of the toxins
. Deadliest in the world
332
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,940
'Okay, where's the poison
. Battle of wits began
333
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:36,027
, It will end when you decide
... And we drink, and find out who is right
334
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,612
. Those who died
335
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:44,202
., But it is very simple
. Should I tell by my acquaintance with you
336
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,206
You are a poison sixty
? National his enemy or
337
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:51,414
A clever man would put the poison
, Its National
338
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:54,834
Because he knows that only a fool
. Would take what they are given an
339
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:58,588
I am not stupid
. Then do not choose the wine in front of you
340
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:02,634
, Surely you know that I am not a fool
And relies on
341
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:05,053
So I can not choose
. Bane of the face
342
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:08,473
? Did you decide
.'s Not even close -
343
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:12,186
, Hayokin comes from Australia
., As everyone knows
344
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:14,604
All Australian residents
. They are criminals
345

I told you I said
., Please, "that's the truth"
476
00:42:50,308 --> 00:42:53,728
It fascinated Roberts
. And when I described the beauty
477
00:42:54,563 --> 00:42:56,523
. Finally, Roberts decided something
478
00:42:56,804 --> 00:43:00,433
He said, "Okay, Wesley
.'ve Never had helps
479
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:04,021

. All agreed to teach me
485
00:43:15,658 --> 00:43:17,409
Finally I became
. Friend of Roberts
486
00:43:18,243 --> 00:43:22,288
. Then it happened. - What? Continuation
487
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,850
, Roberts was very rich
. And wanted to retire
488
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:28,007
He took me to his cabin
. And told me his secret
489
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:34,461
"I do not pirate Roberts"
. "He said." My name is Ryan

. His name was Kmbrvend "
494
00:43:44,984 --> 00:43:46,778
The real Roberts "
495
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:48,697
. "Lived like a king in Patagonia

00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:53,649
, He explained that the name is important
. To spread the fear required
497
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:57,612
Realize, no surrender
. Piracy frightening Wesley
498
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:01,294
, We sailed ashore
, We hired new staff
499
00:44:01,335 --> 00:44:03,796
And he played the part
, My assistant
500
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,756
. "And called me" Roberts
501
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:09,519
When the team believed he left the
. Ship, and since I Roberts
502
00:44:10,463 --> 00:44:14,341
Now we are together, so I retire
. And will pass the name to someone else
503
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:16,473
? It clear to you
504
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:53,780
. Never get
. Better to die here

. Did not ... No, we've managed to
506
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:05,342
I mean, what are the three
? Threats swamp - fire
507
00:46:05,688 --> 00:46:08,901
. Initially, flames
.'s No problem
508
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,987
Before the eruption has crack
. Would avoid them
509
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,364
. Secondly, quicksand
510
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:17,921
, Bfikhotc you find out how it looks
. Therefore we can avoid that too
511
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,593
? Wesley, what about the Police
? Sized rodents -
512
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:24,594
. I do not think they exist
513
00:47:00,964 --> 00:47:02,007
Wesley ...
514
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:17,499
. We
515
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:21,128

01:31:42,854 --> 01:31:46,859
Thought to be spelled out? Succeed

What, what
No, they kiss again -

01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,163
. Did not really care
1025
01:32:23,082 --> 01:32:24,333
