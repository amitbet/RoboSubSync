happen to have six fingers
on your right hand?

Do you always begin
conversations this way?

283

My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

284

He was a great sword maker,
my father.

285
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,863
When the six-fingered man
appeared and requested
a special sword,

286
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,740
my father took the job.

287
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,994
He slaved a year
before he was done.

288

l've never seen its equal.

289
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,885

returned and demanded it,

290
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,305
but at one-tenth
his promised price.

291
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,891
My father refused.

292
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:31,145
Without a word,
the six-fingered man
slashed him through the heart.

293
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,898
l loved my father.

294
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,652
So, naturally, l challenged
his murderer to a duel.

295
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,154
l failed.

296
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,533

leave me alive.

297
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,495
But he gave me this.

298
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,666
How old were you?

299
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,334
l was 1 1 years old.

300
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,712
When l was strong enough,

301
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,174
l dedicated my life
to the study of fencing.

302
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,179
So, the next time we meet,
l will not fail.

303
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,226
l will go up
to the six-fingered man
and say,

to lose confidence.

to pay the bills.

311

There's not a lot of money
in revenge.

312

you find him someday.

313

314
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,261
Whether l am or not,
you've been more than fair.

315
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,723
You seem a decent fellow.
l hate to kill you.

316
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,434
You seem a decent fellow.

00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,603

00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,096
You are using
Bonetti's defense
against me, huh?

319
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,058
l thought it fitting,
considering
the rocky terrain.

320
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,894
Naturally,
you must expect me
to attack with Capo Ferro.

321
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,106
Naturally. But l find
that Thibault cancels out
Capo Ferro, don't you?

has studied his Agrippa.

to become so.

l admit that you are
better than l am.

00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,653
However, since l can't have
you following me, either. . .

348
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,779
(GROANS)

349
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,243
Please understand, l hold you
in the highest respect.

350
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,758
lnconceivable!
Give her to me.

351
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,426
Catch up with us quickly.

352
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,636
What do l do?

353
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,096
Finish him.
Finish him your way!

354
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,933
Oh, good. My way.
Thank you, Vizzini.

355
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,560
Which one's my way?

356
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,980
Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.

357
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,900
ln a few minutes,
the man in black will come
running around the bend.

358
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,779
The minute
his head is in view,
hit it with the rock!

359
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,408
My way's not
very sportsmanlike.

360
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,316
l did that on purpose.
l didn't have to miss.

361
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,110
l believe you.

362
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,654
So what happens now?

363
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,282
We face each other
as God intended.

364
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:21,829
Sportsmanlike.
No tricks. No weapons.
Skill against skill alone.

365
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,624
You mean,
you'll put down your rock
and l'll put down my sword,

366
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,252
and we'll try
and kill each other
like civilized people?

367
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,713
l can kill you now.

368
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:35,926
Frankly, l think the odds
are slightly in your favor
at hand-fighting.

369
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,971
lt's not my fault
for being the biggest
and the strongest.

370
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,764
l don't even exercise.

371
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:54,653
(GRUNTlNG)

372
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,579
Look,
are you just fiddling around
with me, or what?

373
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,081
l just want you to feel
you're doing well.

374
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,292
l hate for people
to die embarrassed.

375
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,962
You're quick.

376
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,130
And a good thing, too.

377
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,548
Why are you wearing a mask?

378
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,842
Were you burned by acid
or something like that?

379
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,802
No, it's just that they're
terribly comfortable.

380
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,929
l think everyone will be
wearing them in the future.

381
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,729
(GRUNTlNG) l just figured why
you give me so much trouble.

382
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,481
(GROANlNG)

383
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,775
Why's that, do you think?

384
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:37,863
Well, l haven't fought
just one person for so long.

385
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,076
l've been specializing
in groups,

386
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,954
battling gangs
for local charities,
that kind of thing.

387
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,460
Why should that make
such a. . .difference?

388
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,380
Well, you see,
you use different moves

389
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,634
(GRUNTlNG)
when you're fighting
half a dozen people

390
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:04,765
than when you only have to be
worried about one.

391
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,115
l do not envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

392
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,119
But in the meantime,
rest well and dream
of large women.

393
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,640
There was a mighty duel.

394
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:53,313
lt ranged all over.
They were both masters.

395
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,442
Who won? How did it end?

396
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,695
The loser ran off alone,

397
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,115
but the winner

398
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,869
followed those footprints
toward Guilder.

399
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,538
Shall we track them both?

400
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,625
The loser is nothing.
Only the Princess matters.

401
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,171
Clearly, this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder.

402
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,090
We must all be ready
for whatever lies ahead.

403
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,050
Could this be a trap?

404
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,428
l always think
everything could be a trap,

405
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,472
which is why l'm still alive.

406
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,526
So, it is down to you

407
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,779
and it is down to me.

408
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,534
lf you wish her dead,
by all means,
keep moving forward.

409
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,287
Let me explain.

410
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,830
There's nothing to explain.

411
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,792
You're trying to kidnap
what l've rightfully stolen.

412
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,711
Perhaps an arrangement
can be reached?

413
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,632
There will be no arrangement,
and you're killing her.

414
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,883
(GASPS)

415
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,638
Well, if there can be
no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.

416
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,725
l'm afraid so. l can't compete
with you physically,

417
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,144
and you're no match
for my brains.

418
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,229
You're that smart?

419
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,396
Let me put it this way.

420
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,775
Have you ever heard of Plato,
Aristotle, Socrates?

421
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,818
Yes.

422
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,944
Morons.

423
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,195
Really?

424
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,907
ln that case, l challenge you
to a battle of wits.

425
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,451
For the Princess?

426
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,829
To the death?

427
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,372
l accept.

428
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,582
Good, then pour the wine.

429
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,725
lnhale this,
but do not touch.

430
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,854
l smell nothing.

431
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,356
What you do not smell is
called iocane powder.

432
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,067
lt is odorless, tasteless,
dissolves instantly in liquid,

433
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,611
and is among
the more deadly poisons
known to man.

434
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,737
Hmm.

435
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,383
(CHUCKLES)

436
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,220
All right.
Where is the poison?

437
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,222
The battle of wits
has begun.

438
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,433
lt ends when you decide,
and we both drink

439
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:38,437
and find out who is right
and who is dead.

440
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,314
But it's so simple.

441
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,692
All l have to do is divine
from what l know of you.

442
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,235
Are you the sort of man

443
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,447
who would put the poison
into his own goblet
or his enemy's?

444
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,408
Now, a clever man
would put the poison
into his own goblet

445
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,745
because he would know
that only a great fool would
reach for what he was given.

446
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,874
l'm not a great fool,
so l can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

447
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,418
But you must have known
l was not a great fool.

448
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:05,422
You would've counted on it,
so l can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

449
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,215
You've made your decision,
then?

450
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,508
Not remotely.

451
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,095
Because iocane
comes from Australia,
as everyone knows,

452
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,806
and Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals,

453
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,184
and criminals
are used to having people
not trust them,

454
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,769
as you are not trusted by me,

455
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,730
so l can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

456
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,440
Truly, you have
a dizzying intellect.

457
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,442
Wait till l get going.

458
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,402
Where was l?
Australia.

459
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,612
Yes. Australia.

460
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,323
And you must have suspected
l would have known
the powder's origin,

461
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,784
so l can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

462
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,035
You're just stalling now.

463
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,537
You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

464
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,707
You've beaten my giant,
which means you're
exceptionally strong,

465
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,793
so you could've put the poison
in your own goblet,

466
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,336
trusting on your strength
to save you,

467
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,130
so l can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

468
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,009
But you've also bested
my Spaniard, which means
you must've studied,

469
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,096
and in studying,
you must have learned
that man is mortal,

470
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,391
so you would've put the poison
as far from yourself
as possible,

471
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,394
so l can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

472
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,647
You're trying to trick me
into giving away something.
lt won't work.

473
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,607
lt has worked !
You've given everything away.

474
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,192
l know where the poison is.

475
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,443
Then make your choice.

476
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,237
l will, and l choose. . .

477
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,155
What in the world
can that be?

478
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,157
What? Where?

479
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,493
l don't see anything.

480
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,662
l could've sworn
l saw something.

481
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,497
No matter.

What's so funny?

484
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,919
l'll tell you in a minute.

485
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,838
First, let's drink,

486
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,091
me from my glass
and you from yours.

(CHUCKLlNG)

488
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,523
You guessed wrong.

489
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,316
You only think
l guessed wrong.

490
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,528
That's what's so funny.
l switched glasses
while your back was turned !

491
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:55,365
(LAUGHlNG) You fool,
you fell victim to one
of the classic blunders.

492
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,535
The most famous is
never get involved
in a land war in Asia,

493
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,621
but only slightly less
well known is this.

494
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,876
Never go in against a Sicilian
when death is on the line!

496
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,975
Who are you?

497
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,727
l'm no one to be trifled with.

498
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,854
That is all
you ever need know.

499
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,900
To think, all that time
it was your cup
that was poisoned.

500
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,651
They were both poisoned.

501
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,323
l spent the last few years
building up an immunity
to iocane powder.

502

Someone has beaten a giant.

503
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:47,042
There will be great suffering
in Guilder if she dies.

504
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,809
Catch your breath.

505
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,268
lf you'll release me,

506
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,772
whatever you ask for ransom,
you'll get it, l promise you.

(LAUGHlNG)

508
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,693
And what is that worth,
the promise of a woman?

509
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,403
You're very funny, Highness.

510
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,366
l was giving you a chance.
lt does not matter
where you take me.

511

There's no greater hunter
than Prince Humperdinck.

He can track a falcon
on a cloudy day.
He can find you.

You think your dearest love
will save you?

l never said
he was my dearest love,

and yes, he will save me.

1370
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,819
Tie him up.

1371
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:11,863
Make it as tight
as you like.

1372
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:13,573
HUMPERDlNCK: Oh.

1373
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,078
Where's Fezzik?

1374
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:20,247
l thought
he was with you.
No.

1375
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:21,832
ln that case. . .

1376
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:23,500
Help him.

1377
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,669
Why does Westley
need helping?

1378
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,170
lNlGO: Because he has
no strength.

1379
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:29,923
l knew it.
l knew you were bluffing !
l knew he was bluffing.

1380
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:31,842
Shall l dispatch him
for you?

1381
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,593
Thank you, but no.
Whatever happens to us,

1382
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:36,513
l want him to live
a long life, alone
with his cowardice.

1383
01:30:37,056 --> 01:30:38,306
FEZZlK: lnigo!

1384
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,518
lnigo, where are you?

1385
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:44,771
Oh, there you are.

1386
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:47,607
lnigo, l saw
the prince's stables.

1387
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:50,527
And there they were.
Four white horses.

1388
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:55,282
And l thought,
"There are four of us,
if we ever find the lady."

1389
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,367
Hello, lady.

1390
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:01,663
So l took them with me,
in case we ever bumped into
each other.

1391
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:03,957
l guess we just did.

1392
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:07,085
Fezzik, you did
something right.

1393
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:10,213
Don't worry,
l won't let it go to my head.

1394
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:32,986
You know,
it's very strange.

1395
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,906
l have been in
the revenge business so long,

1396
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:38,575
now that it's over,

1397
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:41,119
l don't know what to do
with the rest of my life.

1398
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,414
Have you ever
considered piracy?

1399
01:31:44,707 --> 01:31:46,917
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.

GRANDFATHER:
"They rode to freedom.

1401
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:05,435
"And as dawn arose,
Westley and Buttercup knew
they were safe.

1402
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:08,063
"A wave of love
swept over them,

1403
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:10,273
"and as they reached
for each other..."

1404
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:14,694
What? What?

1405
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,113
No, it's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.

1406
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:20,867
l. . . l don't mind so much.

1407
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:24,246
Okay.

1408
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:29,417
"Since the invention
of the kiss, there have
been five kisses

1409
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,921
"that were rated
the most passionate,
the most pure.

1410
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:35,423
"This one left them
all behind.

1411
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:41,972
"The end."

1412
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,810
Now, l think
you ought to go to sleep.

1413
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:59,114
Okay.

1414
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,992
All right.

1415
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:05,996
So long.

1416
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,541
Grandpa?

1417
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:16,339
Maybe you could come over
and read it again
to me tomorrow.

1418
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:20,302
As you wish.

(STORYBOOK LOWE PLAYlNG)

1420
01:35:22,174 --> 01:35:26,428
Come my love
I'll tell you a tale

1421
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:31,433
Of a boy and girl
and their love story

1422
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:37,230
And how he loved her
Oh, so much

1423
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:42,152
And all the charms
she did possess

1424
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:47,824
Now this did happen
once upon a time

1425
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:52,996
When things
were not so complex

1426
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:58,251
And how he worshipped
the ground she walked

1427
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,754
And when he looked
in her eyes

1428
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:03,673
He became obsessed

1429
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:09,429
My love is like
a storybook story

1430
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:14,642
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

It's as real
as the feelings I feel

1434
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:46,508
He said, "Don't you know
I love you, oh, so much

1435
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:51,346
"And lay my heart
at the foot of your dress?"

1436
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:57,060
She said, "Don't you know
that storybook loves

1437
01:36:57,853 --> 01:37:02,607
"Always have
a happy ending?"

1438
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:07,904
Then he swooped her up
just like in the books

1439
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:12,784
And on his stallion
they rode away

1440
