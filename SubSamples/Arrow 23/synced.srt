Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,996
Maybe I'm finally ready
to admit that I still have

3
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:06,315
feelings for you, too.

4
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:10,373
No! Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades!

5
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,709
My father, he told me
that he failed the city,

6
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,811
but I never knew
what he meant until now.

7
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:17,597
Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:26,523
Oh, no!

10
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:29,776
You can survive this.

11
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,528
Make it home.

12
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,280
Make it better.

13
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:36,416
Right my wrongs.

14
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:44,975
Dad?!

15
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:47,294
Survive.

16
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:49,262
No! No!

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,678
I hope I didn't hurt you.

18
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:11,401
At least I can properly thank you
now for saving my life.

19
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:13,536
If I only knew

20
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:17,540
how you were
spending your nights...

21
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:21,294
My hope is that I can
explain everything to you

22
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:23,529
to help you understand.

23
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,715
You murdered my father!

24
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:29,669
You sentenced me
to that island,

25
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:32,973
to five years of hell.

26
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:36,142
I am truly sorry
for what happened to you.

27
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:41,431
You know I have
lost people.

28
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,216
Yeah, your wife.

29
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:45,151
Do you really think

30
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:48,271
that you're honoring
Tommy's mother

31
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:51,825
by destroying
the Glades?

32
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:53,334
As surely as you believe

33
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,476
you're honoring your father
with this hood.

34
00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:59,565
Not a day goes by

35
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,368
I don't miss your father.

36
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,287
You'll see him soon.

37
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:11,878
You can't beat me, Oliver.

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,346
Yes, you're younger.

39
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,964
You're faster,

40
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:17,917
but you always seem
to come up short against me.

41
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,053
Want to know why?

42
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:23,523
Because you don't know,

43
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:27,027
in your heart,
what you're fighting for.

44
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:31,764
What you're willing
to sacrifice, and I do.

45
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:38,238
No one can stop
what's about to come.

46
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:44,444
Not even the Vigilante.

47
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:01,511
The plane's holding steady
at 33,000 feet.

48
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:04,898
That's the range
for missile intercept, sir.

49
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:08,268
Lock missile one
on target.

50
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,354
Missile one locked
on the jet's heat trail.

51
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:14,407
Prepare to launch
on my mark.

52
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:17,026
Yes, sir.

53
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,378
Fire! Fire the missile now!

54
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:42,848
I take back every joke

55
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:45,147
I made about you sticking
a tracking device in your boot.

59
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,711
She's still going through the data
she pulled off Merlyn's network.

60
00:04:58,713 --> 00:04:59,929
Did she find
anything?

61
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,381
Yeah, the design
schematics

62
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:02,748
of the earthquake
generator.

63
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,434
So we can shut it down.

64
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,019
Assuming
we find it in time.

65
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:09,689
Yeah, Felicity,
I got him.

66
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:12,058
Thank God.
Is he ok?

67
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,143
Mostly.
Ok.

68
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:15,695
I'm on my way.

69
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:18,264
Miss Smoak.

70
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:25,321
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

71
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:31,277
Please.

72
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,664
Take a seat.

73
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,883
You know, I think
I'd rather stand.

74
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,920
You're not exactly
a hardened criminal, are you?

75
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,472
No, I'm not
any kind of criminal.

76
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,457
What do you call
computer hacking?

77
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,676
A hobby?

78
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:49,312
That I do not engage in.

79
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,368
Hey, I got a whole mess

80
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,684
of computer gobbedly gook
that I don't understand,

81
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,735
but it says otherwise.

82
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,678
I had my tech guys
go through your computer

83
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,179
at Queen Consolidated.

84
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:02,475
You used it to hack into
blackhawk squad security

85
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,494
to research arrows shipped to
a company called Sagittarius

86
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:07,023
and to analyze a water
sample to tie back

87
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:07,948
to a Vertigo drug lab.

88
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,250
These are all cases

89
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:13,819
involving...The Hood.

90
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,039
Tell me, Felicity.

91
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,124
What am I thinking?

92
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,762
Saved by the bell.

93
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:25,098
Excuse me.

94
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,468
Hello, Detective.

95
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,186
It's funny
you should call.

96
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:32,906
I got your trusty sidekick sitting
right in front of me.

97
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,140
I don't have a sidekick.

98
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:36,392
When I need help,
I call you.

99
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:39,562
Malcolm Merlyn plans to level
the Glades with a manmade earthquake

100
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:43,349
using technology
from Unidac Industries.

101
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:46,369
What?

102
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,122
Now you're just
trying to have some fun with me.

103
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,324
I don't know what
Merlyn's timetable is,

104
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,493
so you need to evacuate
the Glades immediately.

105
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:55,545
Get as many people
to safety as you can.

106
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,797
Whatever you think
of me, Detective,

107
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:01,751
please...believe this.

108
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:07,774
Sounds like you have
bigger problems than me.

109
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,481
Don't leave town.

110
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,554
You know...

111
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:24,524
I used to think the Vigilante
was a criminal, too,

112
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:27,410
but it seems to me,
whoever he is,

113
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,362
he's willing to sacrifice
an awful lot

114
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:33,249
to help the people
of this city.

115
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,401
Kind of makes him
a hero...

116
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,036
Doesn't it?

117
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:41,061

118
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:46,086
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

119
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,847
Look who it is.

120
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,484
My best friend in life.

121
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:55,885
Hey, buddy.

122
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,906
I took your advice,
you know.

123
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:03,660
I went to Laurel's,
to fight for her.

124
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,279
So imagine my surprise

125
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:09,332
seeing you there,
kissing her.

126
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,567
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:13,002
No, you're not.

128
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:19,876
Something's happening,
and it involves your father.

129
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,211
Keep my father
out of this.

130
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,131
Our fathers.
They aren't the men

131
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,016
we thought they were.

132
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:29,686
They made a plan together...

133
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:33,439
to destroy the Glades.

134
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:37,360
Do you have any idea
what you sound like right now?

135
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:39,696
Your father's going to do it.

136
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,900
Because he thinks
it will avenge your mother's death.

137
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:46,736
Do not talk about
my mother!

138
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,912
The difference

139
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:58,548
between us, Tommy,

140
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,385
is that I didn't find out the truth
about my father

141
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:05,254
until it was too late.

142
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,674
But you've always known,

143
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:10,292
deep down,

144
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:14,964
you have always known
the man he is.

145
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:21,738
I wish you would have
died on that island.

146
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:57,273
We need to reprogram
the missile.

147
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,892
I don't know how to reprogram
a missile launcher!

148
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:04,513
I do.
Watch out!

149
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:19,695
Oliver, put the chip in.

150
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:11,097
Make it quick,
I got a comm stat meeting in five.

151
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,882
I don't want to be late for
my own funeral.

152
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:14,634
I've got it under
good authority

153
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:16,269
that Malcolm Merlyn
is planning on leveling the Glades

154
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:18,437
using some kind
of earthquake device

155
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,189
made by Unidac
Industries.

156
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,924
Who's your source
in all this?

157
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:24,426
The Vigilante.

158
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:27,730
He called me.

159
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:30,333
Has been
for the last few months,

160
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,703
he's been helpful
on some cases.

161
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,822
You asked for the task
force to catch him.

162
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:37,573
You swore to me you'd bring him in.
I know.

163
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,659
I swore to uphold the law,
because the law is steady,

164
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:42,278
the law is unchanging,
the law needed to be protected.

165
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,833
But what are laws, rules,

166
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,584
if they don't protect people?

167
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:51,387
Now listen, I know,
I'm throwing away my career

168
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,055
by telling you this,
but I am willing to sacrifice

169
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:57,226
catching this guy
if it means saving people's lives!

170
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:59,512
Please.

171
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,517
You're suspended.

172
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,986
Leave the gun and your badge
with the duty sergeant.

173
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:10,106
Lieutenant...
Suspension or incarceration.

174
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:12,358
You choose.

175
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,995
No more lies, Mom.

176
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:35,298
The Undertaking.

177
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,016
We need to stop it.

178
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:39,719
Everything I have ever
said or done

179
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:43,139
has been to protect you
and your sister.

180
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:46,225
What about all those
people in the Glades?

181
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:49,061
I'm not their mother.

182
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:52,681
I spoke to Malcolm.
You what?!

183
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,986
He could have killed you.

184
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:02,458
He killed your father.

185
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,377
No, he didn't.

186
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,829
After the "Gambit"
went down,

187
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,766
dad and I both made it
to the life raft.

188
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:14,170
And then we drifted,
for days.

189
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,138
In the end,
there wasn't enough

190
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,375
food and water
for both of us.

191
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:23,646
So he shot himself
in the head.

192
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:26,182
I don't want to hear this.

193
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:28,935
He sacrificed himself...

194
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:30,937
So that I could live.

195
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:33,022
Do you really think

196
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:35,491
that I could
go on living

197
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,576
knowing that
you sacrificed

198
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:41,030
thousands more
in my name?

199
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:42,865
Mom.

200
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,900
Please.

201
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:47,569
You have to help me

202
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:49,338
stop Malcolm.

203
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,842
We need to know
where the device is.

204
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,856
Malcolm.

205
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,141
How can I help you?

206
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,197
I see.

207
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,817
Yes, thank you
for calling.

208
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,618
What is it?

209
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,321
Malcolm's accelerated
his timetable.

210
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:25,041
The Undertaking is...

211
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:27,660
Is happening tonight.

212
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:33,666
Where you going?

213
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:40,556
Somebody in this family
needs to put an end to this.

214
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,294
Whatever the cost.

215
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,318
Hi.

216
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:08,657
Hey.

217
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,043
I woke up and you were gone.

218
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,079
I'm really sorry
about that.

219
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,465
Oliver, I'm trying
not to think

220
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:20,252
that our history's repeating;
That you're scared again.

221
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,321
No.

222
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:24,023
That's not it.

223
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:27,876
Then will you tell me what's
going on with you?

224
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,433
There are so many things

225
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:37,186
that I have wanted
to tell you

226
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,605
for so long.

227
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:45,327
I never told you what
happened to me on the island.

228
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,496
You didn't have to.

229
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:49,281
I can see that
it changed you.

230
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,700
That's the thing.

231
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,787
Laurel, it didn't.

232
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,422
Those five years
didn't change me.

233
00:15:56,424 --> 00:16:00,042
They just...
They scraped away

234
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,878
all the things that I wasn't,

235
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,514
and revealed the person
I always was,

236
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,684
which is the person...

237
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:11,904
That's who you always saw.

238
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:16,942
I don't know how you saw it,
but you did.

239
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:20,595
Nobody in my life
is who I thought they were...

240
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,931
Except you.

241
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:41,383
Laurel, I need you
to do something for me.

242
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:43,385
Stay out of the Glades tonight.

243
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,503
Why?

244
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,056
You'll know soon.

245
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:49,675
One way or the other.

246
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:53,429
I have to go.

247
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,741
It's over.

248
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:08,861
Laurel and me, I mean.

249
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,297
She's with Oliver,
again. Always.

250
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,782
I'm sorry, Son.

251
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,167
Yeah, and he said

252
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,653
you wanted to nuke
the Glades or something.

253
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,507
You know,
it's funny,

254
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,375
scotch doesn't make it
any more believable.

255
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,344
Maybe after your jihad,

256
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,963
we can grab
some steaks.

257
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,968
It's true, Tommy.

258
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,438
It's the reason
I closed your mother's clinic.

259
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,724
I didn't want
to see it leveled.

260
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,861
What?

261
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:45,447
I have something
I'd like you to listen to.

262
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,654
The night
your mother died,

263
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,540
she called me.

264
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:57,960
I awoke to a voicemail
from her.

265
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:59,361
Dad...

266
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:03,215
Her final gift to me.

267
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:07,252
Malcolm,
I'm in trouble.

268
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,422
I told--I told him
to take everything.

269
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,342
My money...my ring.

270
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:16,011
Turn it off.

271
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,164
They shot me.
I screamed for help,

272
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,483
but no one would come.
No one would come.

273
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:26,955
Malcolm, I don't want
to die alone.

274
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:31,193
She bled out into the pavement
while people passed,

275
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,829
did nothing.

276
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,499
Your mother
built her clinic in the Glades

277
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:40,569
because she wanted
to save this city.

278
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:43,172
It can't be saved.

279
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:47,142
Because the people
there don't want it to be saved.

280
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:49,127
So you kill them all--

281
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,846
Yes!

282
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,414
They deserve to die!

283
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,799
All of them!

284
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,069
The way she died.

285
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:05,644
The Undertaking
is happening tonight.

286
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:11,316
Oliver, Felicity
may have found something.

287
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,603
This symbol is a map of the old
subway tunnel system.

288
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,054
That's what got us
thinking the Undertaking

289
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,790
is connected to the Glades.

290
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,124
What if it's more
specific than that?

291
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,942
What do you mean?
If I had a machine

292
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:23,412
that could trigger
an earthquake in an otherwise

293
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:26,915
geologically stable area,
where would I position it?

294
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,951
Underground.

295
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:32,387
Yeah.

296
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:33,972
This is a U.S.
geological survey

297
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:36,758
of the tectonic plates
running underneath Starling City.

298
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,594
This red line here
is a known fault

299
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,629
that runs right below
the Glades.

300
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:41,946
About a mile, the fault
runs underneath the old

301
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,399
Tenth Street subway line.

302
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,935
Dollars to donuts, the seismic
device is somewhere along there.

303
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,737
I know where it is.

304
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,044
Now is not a good time.

305
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,579
Yeah, understate much?

306
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:59,981
Mom has a whole bunch
of reporters here.

307
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:03,818
She's holding a press conference
or something.

308
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,455
What channel?

309
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,173
Ah, it looks like
all of them.

310
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:11,326
Felicity, pull up
the local news, please.

311
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,297
My name is
Moira Dearden Queen.

312
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,767
I am the acting CEO
of Queen Consolidated.

313
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:22,888
And God forgive me,
I have failed the city.

314
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,442
For the past five years,
under the threat for my life

315
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:29,861
and the lives of my family...

316
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:33,615
I have been complicit
in an undertaking

317
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:36,768
with one horrible purpose--

318
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,824
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

319
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,577
I realize now

320
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,713
that my family's safety
will mean nothing

321
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:50,666
if I let this
dreadful act occur.

322
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,718
But you need to know

323
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,140
that the architect
of this nightmare...

324
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:00,208
is Malcolm Merlyn.

325
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,810
No!

326
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:05,013
Yes, and I have proof
that he has killed dozens

327
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,881
in pursuit of this madness.

328
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:10,152
Adam Hunt, Frank Chen,

329
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:11,937
and my husband...

330
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,856
Robert.

331
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,446
Please.

332
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:25,000
If you reside in the Glades,
you need to get out now.

333
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:29,037
Your lives and the lives
of your children depend on it.

334
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,840
Please.

335
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:40,799
I don't understand.

336
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm sorry. I love you.

337
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,886
I love Roy.
Roy?

338
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,222
He lives
in the Glades.

339
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,808
I can't leave him there.
Sweetheart--Thea!

340
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,694
Moira Queen, you're under arrest
for conspiracy.

341
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,780
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

342
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:57,065
You have the right
to an attorney.

343
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,568
Is it true?

344
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,739
Did you kill
all those people?

345
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,907
I did what I had to do.

346
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,319
Freeze!

347
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:38,306
Malcolm Merlyn,
you are under arrest.

348
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,313
Dad, no!

349
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:51,319
Please, Dad.

350
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:54,539
Stay back.

351
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,324
I don't want to hurt you.

352
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:58,110
You can't.

353
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,929
And you can't stop me.

354
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,936
Oliver, I'm sorry.

355
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,805
Don't be.

356
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,974
She gave those
people a chance.

357
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,677
I thought Merlyn
broke your bow.

358
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:20,982
I have another.

359
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,621
I was going over
the device schematics.

360
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,707
The device can be set
for a timed detonation

361
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,543
or can be remote activated
by a mobile transmitter.

362
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,994
Something Merlyn
could have on him.

363
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,162
Listen, Oliver,
if we can just

364
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,747
get our hands
on this transmitter,

365
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,082
maybe we don't need
to track down the device.

366
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:38,550
It's too big
of an "if," Diggle.

367
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,268
I need you
in the subway.

368
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,138
Find the device,
disarm it.

369
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,756
So you can take on
Merlyn by yourself?

370
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,592
I have to.

371
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,662
Oh, he'll kill you, Oliver.

372
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:52,931
I know.

373
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,569
He's beaten me twice.

374
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:01,439
And I don't know
how to stop him.

375
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,777
Ok. Well, how about this time,
you bring along something

376
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,914
you didn't have the last time
you two fought--

377
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,249
Me.
I can't let you.

378
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:13,034
I can't let you do this
by yourself, man.

379
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,453
Oliver, you are not alone,

380
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,305
not since
you brought me into this.

381
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:20,458
Us into this.

382
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:24,930
Besides, army regulations--

383
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:27,966
a soldier never lets
a brother go into battle alone.

384
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,142
I'm out of bows.
I got my gun.

385
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,277
I guess it's up to me
to do the dismantling.

386
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,646
This whole area
is ground zero.

387
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,365
I want you
out of here.

388
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,817
If you're not leaving,
I'm not leaving.

389
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,270
Besides, if I don't
deactivate the device,

390
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:50,438
who will?

391
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,800
You were right.

392
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,501
I need one more
thing from you.

393
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,837
Yeah? What do I got
left to give?

394
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,806
I know where Merlyn
is keeping the device.

395
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:11,393
It's in an abandoned subway
station near Puckett Street.

396
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:13,762
How do you know?

397
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,097
That's where
his wife was murdered.

398
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,634
I need someone I can trust
to deactivate the device.

399
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,138
We have a mutual friend
that I think could...

400
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,824
Talk you through it.

401
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:28,276
She says you care
about the people of this city,

402
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,779
that it needs you.

403
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,698
Right now, Detective...

404
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,534
It needs you.

405
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,300
Earlier today, Moira Queen,
CEO of Queen Consolidated,

406
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,186
admitted to a conspiracy
to destroy the Glades.

407
00:25:57,488 --> 00:26:00,105
Everyone within a five mile
radius is asked to evacuate.

408
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:03,442
Please leave the area
immediately.

409
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:06,895
Evacuation centers
have been set up in Starling City.

410
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:58,163
Looks like we missed him.

411
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,672
Shado!

412
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:09,591
Slade!

413
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:34,950
Boy, I should
have figured.

414
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:37,485
You couldn't
save the day...

415
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:40,872
without making a mess.

416
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:42,124
Where's Shado?

417
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:43,875
I thought
she was with you.

418
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:45,827
Actually...

419
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,629
She's with me.

420
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:50,716
Let her go!
It's over, Fyers!

421
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:58,106
Let her go.

422
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:00,175
Amazing.

423
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:03,028
A two year operation undone

424
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,365
because a young playboy happened
to wash up on the shore,

425
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:09,684
and now here you are--
a killer.

426
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:14,355
You wanted
nothing more than to leave this island,

427
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:15,907
and now you can.

428
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:19,494
I can call in a rescue ship,
you can go home.

429
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:21,580
Tell me, Mr. Queen.

430
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:24,299
Are you prepared
to sacrifice your freedom...

431
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:25,751
For her?

432
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:41,183
Guess so.

433
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:59,334
Tommy.

434
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,169
Tommy. Tommy!

435
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:02,671
Oliver.

436
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:05,457
Where's your father?

437
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,709
Ohh. I don't know.

438
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,178
You were right.

439
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,248
You were right about him.

440
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,883
Oliver.

441
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:20,255
Are you going to kill him?

442
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:26,427
Get to safety.

443
00:29:34,103 --> 00:29:37,605
Looks like a false wall.

444
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,134
Welcome, gentlemen.

445
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:52,220
I've been waiting for you.
I wanted to see you

446
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:54,055
watch your city die.

447
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:55,724
Where's
the transmitter?

448
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:57,476
Somewhere I can
easily get to it.

449
00:29:57,478 --> 00:30:00,729
I doubt it.
You'll be too dead.

450
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:20,115
Aaah!

451
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:27,622
Stairs. Go, go.

452
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:36,882
So tell me--
are you ready to die?

453
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:40,385
You found it yet, Detective?

454
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,270
Not exactly sure
what I'm looking for.

455
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:45,307
Do you want me
to describe it to you?

456
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:48,176
No, I've got it.

457
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:56,077
You should see something
that looks like a circuit board.

458
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,730
Pull it out.
Do you see a timer?

459
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:03,950
Seven minutes.

460
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:06,586
Ok. Well, the good news is,

461
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:09,572
this is going to be
a paperweight in three.

462
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:15,962
What do you got there, grandpa?

463
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:19,632
Hey! Hey!

464
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:21,417
Hey!

465
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,269
Back off!

466
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:26,472
Learn how to count, jerkwad.
There's three of us.

467
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:28,090
Oh, is that right?

468
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:39,152
'Cause I only count one.

469
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:41,437
With a gun.

470
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:46,376
Where did you learn
how to do that?

471
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:48,327
I guess I have wicked aim.

472
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:51,047
What?
I went to your house.

473
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,166
Yeah, I figured I'd run for my life
with everyone else.

474
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:55,501
Did you--did you
come to rescue me?

475
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:57,453
Yeah.

476
00:31:57,455 --> 00:31:59,505
Come on.

477
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:23,579
There are three wires--
you need a green one,

478
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:26,249
a yellow and one blue.

479
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:27,417
Cut the blue.

480
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,118
All right,
I got it, I got it.

481
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:37,827
Oh, my God.

482
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:41,597
No, no, no, no, no!

483
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,016
There must be some sort
of anti-tamper safeguard.

484
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:48,054
Hold on. I'm going to try to
figure out how to override it.

485
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:50,223
Not enough time.
There's not enough time!

486
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:51,641
Just hold on!

487
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:53,559
Not enough time.

488
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:57,947
Laurel.

489
00:32:57,949 --> 00:33:00,066
Dad, don't worry,
I got your message,

490
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:02,852
and I did not
come into work today.

491
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:05,121
Save it, kiddo,
we both know you're there.

492
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:06,789
But listen--you got to
get out of the Glades.

493
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,158
You got to get out of
the Glades right now! Ok, please.

494
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,144
Dad?

495
00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:14,330
Right now, Laurel!
Right now, Laurel!

496
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:16,499
Daddy,
you're scaring me.

497
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,085
Sorry, but I'm not...

498
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:21,921
I'm not going
to make it.

499
00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:24,423
What?

500
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,725
What?!

501
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,143
You have to promise me
one thing, Laurel.

502
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:30,229
You're not going
to die along with me.

503
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:33,516
You have to go on
with your life.

504
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:35,217
After your sister died,
I pushed people away,

505
00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:36,652
I became like a ghost.

506
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:38,404
I didn't think I had
the right to live

507
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:41,190
when my baby girl
didn't.

508
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:42,792
Promise me
you're not going

509
00:33:42,794 --> 00:33:45,060
to make the same
mistakes as I did.

510
00:33:45,062 --> 00:33:46,496
Where are you?

511
00:33:46,498 --> 00:33:49,665
Promise me, Laurel.

512
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,668
Promise me.

513
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,454
I promise.

514
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:05,314
I love you, honey,
now and forever.

515
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:07,917
I love you.

516
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:11,521
Dad!

517
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:14,273
Detective Lance?

518
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:18,361
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

519
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,898
You do know how dangerous

520
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,866
it is to text and drive,
right? It can wait!

521
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:25,568
No, it can't. I'm trying to find us
another route out of here.

522
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,704
Let me. It's not
worth the risk.

523
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:30,957
Roy!

524
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:34,327
Roy!

525
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,779
Help me out! Help me out!
Help me out!

526
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,664
Roy, stop! Roy!

527
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:42,168
The device is about
to go off any second!

528
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:46,055
I can't leave
anyone behind.

529
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:48,457
I know you think
you have something to prove.

530
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:51,561
But you're not the Vigilante!

531
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:54,981
I can't do this
unless I know you're safe.

532
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:58,401
Then you better
haul ass out of it.

533
00:35:36,723 --> 00:35:40,860
Don't struggle.
It's over.

534
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:43,195
There was never any
doubt in the outcome.

535
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:47,233
Don't worry. Your mother
and sister will be joining you in death.

536
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:49,318
Survive.

537
00:36:05,253 --> 00:36:08,321
Thank you
for teaching me

538
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:11,707
what I'm fighting for.

539
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:16,211
But my father taught me how.

540
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:27,490
Come on!

541
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,453
Oliver,
Lance did it.

542
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:43,339
It's over.

543
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:45,875
If I've learned anything
as a successful businessman,

544
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:49,345
it's...

545
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,964
Redundancy.

546
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,093
Felicity...

547
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:07,096
there's another device.

548
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:10,649
There's two of them!

549
00:37:17,657 --> 00:37:19,608
What the hell's
happening?!

550
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:25,280
Ok, that's enough.

551
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:29,335
Ohh!

552
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:52,681
I turned
the damn thing off!

553
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:56,384
Merlyn had a second device!

554
00:37:56,386 --> 00:38:00,922
My daughter! Laurel!
She's at CNRI!

555
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:04,359
Run!

556
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:25,213
Laurel!

557
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:26,832
Oliver?

558
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:29,384
Are you ok?

559
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:31,720
Yeah.

560
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:37,792
The damage seems
to be contained

561
00:38:37,794 --> 00:38:40,729
on the east side,

562
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:42,364
past Wells Street.

563
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:44,015
Laurel.

564
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:46,101
Are you going
to be ok?

565
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:48,937
Go, go, go.

566
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,076
Help!

567
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:04,252
Please! Help me!

568
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:07,422
Tommy!

569
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:09,758
What are you doing here?

570
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,377
I kind of figured that you might
come back to CNRI.

571
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:16,765
You came here for me?

572
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:21,303
I love you.

573
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:31,179
Get up! Go!

574
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,982
I'm right behind you!

575
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:36,701
Laurel! Laurel!

576
00:39:36,703 --> 00:39:39,687
Dad! Dad!
Oh, thank God.

577
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,076
No!

578
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:47,996
No! Laurel!
No, you can't!

579
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,965
Tommy!
You can't!

580
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:55,971
It's too late,
it's too late.

581
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:03,345
Tommy!

582
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:15,774
Ah, Tommy.

583
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:18,860
You're going to be fine.

584
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:22,730
Another thing...
We got to disagree on.

585
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,906
Tommy...

586
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:34,259
Is--is Laurel safe?

587
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:36,711
Is Laurel safe?
I tried to get her out of here.

588
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:39,965
Yeah, yeah, you did.

589
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,434
You saved her.

590
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:45,053
I'm going to get you
out of here.

591
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,554
You're going to be fine.

592
00:40:46,556 --> 00:40:48,589
Stop.

593
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:55,563
I'm sorry.

594
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:57,532
No. Don't apologize.

595
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:59,484
I was angry.

596
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:03,538
And I was jealous. I--

597
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,875
I am my father.

598
00:41:06,877 --> 00:41:08,776
No.

599
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:10,245
No, you're not.

600
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:14,062
Did--did you kill him?

601
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,634
No.

602
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:23,006
Thank you.

603
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,377
No, no!

604
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,765
Tommy!

605
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:38,388
It should have been me.

606
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,891
Open your eyes, Tommy!

607
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:50,066
Open your eyes.
