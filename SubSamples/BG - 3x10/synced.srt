1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,860
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,265
l was burnt out.

3
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,308
l started taking... stims.

4
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:30,545
- What are these?
- Stims.

5
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:35,745
And by the look of it,
she's been taking them by the handful.

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,628
Coming in late cos you're hungover is
bad, but when you back out on a mission?

7
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:42,908
Unlike you,
l don't take a bunch of pills...

8
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,213
and then climb in my cockpit so wired
that l can't land the frakking ship.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,866
Starbuck, you're an embarrassment.

10
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:56,228
l need you back in the CIC.

11
00:00:56,328 --> 00:01:00,546
It just ain't the same without you in there...
intimidating the inmates.

12
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:01,696
No, no.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,185
There are 12 Cylon models. But in the
occupation on New Caprica, l saw seven.

14
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,585
- Who are the final five?
- l can't talk about that.

15
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,666
<i>(Baltar) What is it talking about?</i>

16
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:17,225
<i>(Number Six) Most Cylons think</i>
the mind of the hybrid has gone mad...

17
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,508
and the vocalisations are meaningless.

18
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:22,027
But not everyone thinks that.

19
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:25,788
You'll delete the order from your logs.
Execute.

20
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:27,190
<i>(gunshot)...</i>

21
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,829
<i>(gasps)</i>

22
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:31,480
It's OK. It's OK.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,117
There is something beautiful...

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,556
miraculous,
between life and death.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,106
There's no food to be salvaged?
What about the good food we had stored...

26
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:13,468
before we started
churning out the contaminated stuff?

27
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,349
The newly processed bad food...

28
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,108
went into the depleted storage system.
Everything's tainted.

29
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,989
<i>(Cottle) Sharon's finding algae</i>
<i>for us to process.</i>

30
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:24,907
It's tough to choke down,
but it's almost pure protein.

31
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:30,307
What if Sharon comes back and reports
there is no clear passage to this planet?

32
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:33,785
Then the question is, Doc,
how long can we survive?

33
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:38,426
With the rations we've been on?
l'd say seven to ten days.

34
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,788
<i>- (Roslin) When is she due back?</i>
- She was due three hours ago.

35
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:46,580
The, uh, radiation levels are high,
but she's strong and...

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,480
she's, uh...

37
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,700
She'll be here any moment.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,710
- No, l'm sorry. l don't have anything.
- To share.

39
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,829
l told you, Starbuck, l don't have anything.
Get off my back.

40
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:30,145
- l saw a protein bar.
- l gave it to Cottle.

41
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,146
Right. Right after l gave him head.

42
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,188
- Now l'm a liar?!
- If the shoe fits...

43
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:35,946
All right, can it!

44
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:38,474
Kat, get down here.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,770
All right. For frak's sake, everybody eat.
We're getting paranoid over this hunger.

46
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,828
<i>(Kat) Here, baby. Eat this.</i>

47
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:04,988
<i>(Starbuck) Oh, my gods, that's good.</i>

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
<i>(alarm)...</i>

49
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,547
<i>(Baltar) Somewhere to be, D'Anna?</i>

50
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:45,155
<i>(Number Three) Ssh. You'll wake Caprica.</i>

51
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,795
l'd love to hang around with you two
all day, but... l got things to do.

52
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,548
l'll never understand
what you all do all day long,

53
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,133
living on this thing like fleas on a cat.

54
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,746
Where do you suppose
she takes herself off to, then?

55
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:10,386
- You're not the only one asking that.
- l'm not?

56
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,349
What do you mean?

57
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:17,150
- She's been doing things.
- "Doing things"?

58
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,429
What things?

59
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,715
<i>(loud hissing)...</i>

60
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,165
<i>(talking drowned out by noise)...</i>

61
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,140
<i>(man) Go ahead,</i>
l've got your helmet.

62
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,040
- There you go. Got you.
<i>- (man #2) Easy.</i>

63
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,708
<i>(man) Prepare the starboard side</i>
for wash down.

64
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:53,745
- All the way down to fifth.
<i>- (man #2) Right through here, Lieutenant.</i>

65
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:56,354
Radiation negative.

66
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,660
There's a way through the star cluster.

67
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,549
And l found the planet,
on the other side.

68
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:08,307
l skimmed it, l took photos.

69
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:12,657
There's huge swaths of algae,
just like we thought.

70
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,506
- It's black.
<i>- (Apollo) She's a Cylon.</i>

71
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:17,665
She can handle a radiation dose that big.

72
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:21,305
- We think. Someone call Cottle!
- l'm fine.

73
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:25,669
Maybe you are, but...
a human might not be able to make it.

74
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:30,189
So then how do we get tens of thousands
of humans through there?

75
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:34,426
<i>(Sharon) So we can make it through</i>
in two jumps with a stop right there.

76
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:37,788
- There's no solution with a single jump?
- The cluster's too big.

77
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:39,509
It's too big to go around, too.

78
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:43,384
Civvy ships aren't shielded enough
to jump in the middle of that radiation.

79
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:45,987
l would say 80% of the people
on board would die.

80
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:49,226
<i>- Can we send Galactica for food?</i>
- And put it where?

81
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:51,109
- What?
- It'd take dozens of trips.

82
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,309
Each time we'd leave the fleet vulnerable.
We can't bring the food to the people.

83
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,105
What if we bring the people to the food,
<i>put the people on Galactica?</i>

84
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:03,346
Send the civilian ships with skeleton crew,
give them radiation meds.

85
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:06,905
Except that the radiation
would fry the civvy ships' nav systems.

86
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:11,466
They wouldn't be able to see squat. There
wouldn't be a way to calculate a jump out.

87
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:15,866
It's worse than that. Once you jump in,
the light is so blinding you begin to drift,

88
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:19,830
and before you can get your bearings...
you're over there.

89
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,188
<i>(Apollo) No visual contact.</i>
Instruments blinded by radiation.

90
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:26,192
They'd get lost, they'd burn up.

91
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,890
Pilot ship.

92
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:37,705
We pair a Raptor with each civilian ship.

93
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:42,149
Raptor navigation systems are hardened.
They could handle the radiation.

94
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:45,189
Each Raptor leads a civilian ship
through the cluster,

95
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:48,094
then they both jump out together.

96
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,519
The question is...
how many jumps will it take?

97
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,946
Five round trips.

98
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:58,425
You heard. Five round trips.

99
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,984
On our outbound jumps,
we'll each be responsible...

100
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:04,385
for relaying jump coordinates
to our own specific civilian ship,

101
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:07,748
nailing them to jump points
and ensuring they don't drift off.

102
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,826
Sir, will we get fed when we get there?

103
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,827
Eventually, yes, but only after
we find the algae and get it processed.

104
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:14,677
Oh!

105
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:19,429
But the truth is, nausea from radiation
exposure will take care of our appetites.

106
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,825
You'll all be issued with
radiation badges to track our exposure.

107
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:27,109
White, like this, you're OK.
As your exposure increases, it'll darken.

108
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,707
If it approaches this,
you'll be pulled from duty.

109
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:33,148
Keep checking your badges.
It's every pilot's own responsibility...

110
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:36,308
to monitor their own badge.
Starbuck.

111
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,427
Remember, we're all flying solo
on this mission.

112
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:44,389
So there'll be nobody
to bitch slap you if you get tired...

113
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:48,510
or start seeing toasters on your wing.
We'll be issuing stims, so use them.

114
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,506
Are you crazy?
We can't use stims.

115
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,825
- Problem?
- Stims amp up your metabolism.

116
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,465
We've got nothing to burn.
We'll be flying into the sides of the ships.

117
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:58,987
- They'd mess us up?
- You used to like stims, Kat.

118
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:01,188
Personal discretion on the stims.

119
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:04,628
We're taking the first load of civilians
on board as we speak.

120
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:07,533
That's it.
Skids up in four hours.

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,666
<i>(Dualla) There is no food here. There are</i>
no rations anywhere on this ship.

122
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:20,709
If someone told you there was food,
they were lying!

123
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,786
If you leave this area,
force will be used.

124
00:10:23,886 --> 00:10:30,941
Once we get through the star cluster, you
will be returned to your designated ships.

125
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,340
Sacha!

126
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,587
<i>(man) Keep following.</i>
Down to the front.

127
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:43,267
My name isn't "Sacha".

128
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,586
My name is Captain Louanne Katraine,
you understand me?

129
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:49,310
Sacha and you were a lifetime ago.

130
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,895
Right, right.
Cos you got this now, right?

131
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,430
No more hanging with the sinners, huh?

132
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,071
Stay away from me.
Do you understand me?

133
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,345
Do they even know who you really are?

134
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,146
Fancy bumping into you here.
Can you believe l'm lost again?

135
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:25,190
l can never find my way around this place.
Where have you been?

136
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,230
l've been talking with Simon about our
move toward Earth. There's some debate.

137
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:35,580
Of course, if l spoke to the relevant Simon
he'd ascertain you were at this meeting?

138
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,796
Beg your pardon?

139
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,348
l hear that you've been
going off by yourself, "doing things".

140
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:44,830
Really?

141
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,668
Now, who would tell you
<i>anything about my business?</i>

142
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:53,070
- So it's true?
- Caprica?

143
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,748
Did you know you have
some dried goo in your hair?

144
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,823
That can happen when you resurrect.

145
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,630
Now l understand what you've been
doing with yourself all these afternoons.

146
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,425
Do you have any idea
what you are accusing me of?

147
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:11,425
Yes...

148
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:17,507
Intentionally killing yourself over and over
so you can download over and over.

149
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:21,347
But death's just a revolving door, isn't it?

150
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Come here!

151
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,430
Ooh!

152
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:34,467
What do you want?!

153
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:39,185
Take it down a notch, baby. Relax.
l'm not looking for a business partner.

154
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,266
l told you to stay the frak away from me.

155
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:46,470
Yeah, cos if they find out who you are,
they'll kick you out the service, or worse.

156
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,067
Now, do you think l want that?

157
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,705
l don't want that,
cos if that happens...

158
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,440
<i>who's gonna feed me? (sniggers)</i>

159
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,590
Oh, come on,
you're getting three squares.

160
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,666
We don't.
And l don't have anything stashed, Enzo.

161
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,766
Yeah, sure you don't.

162
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,635
Oh, we go back, baby.

163
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,555
Since when is it a crime to...
take care of your own? Hm?

164
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,230
Remember, l know who you are,
and l know how to make you happy.

165
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,110
Get your hands off of me.

166
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,120
Colonel.

167
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,390
Go ahead.

168
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,509
<i>- (man) Welcome back, sir.</i>
<i>- (woman) Good to see you, sir.</i>

169
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,389
<i>(man #2) Colonel's back on board.</i>

170
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:24,674
<i>- (man #3) Welcome, sir.</i>
<i>- (man #4) It's good to see you, sir.</i>

171
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,429
<i>- (man #5) We're with you, sir.</i>
<i>- (man #6) Welcome back.</i>

172
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:32,929
Enough!
Don't you people have jobs to do?

173
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,130
- Welcome back, Colonel.
- Admiral.

174
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,268
<i>Apollo, Galactica.</i>
Launch Raptors on your orders.

175
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,788
<i>(Apollo) Shepherds, find your sheep.</i>
<i>Stay close. Never let them go.</i>

176
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:52,669
<i>These crews are counting on us.</i>

177
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,986
<i>- Apollo, Starbuck on station.</i>
<i>- (Kat) l got visual on "Chiron".</i>

178
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,710
<i>(Apollo) Hotdog.</i>
<i>"Adriatic" in sight. OK.</i>

179
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,350
When you jump in,
you'll be disoriented.

180
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,229
<i>Take it one step at a time.</i>

181
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:07,706
<i>Find your sheep, work the jump</i>
<i>calculations and get them out.</i>

182
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:12,026
<i>Remember, we do not stay</i>
<i>beyond our radiation-dose limit.</i>

183
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:14,787
<i>(Hoshi) Apollo reports pilots in position, sir.</i>

184
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:18,228
Initiate jump on his command.
<i>Galactica will follow.</i>

185
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:20,470
<i>(man) Aye aye, sir.</i>

186
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,385
Raptors, Apollo.
We jump on my mark.

187
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:29,545
<i>- Three, two...</i>
- Jumping...

188
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,645
<i>...one. Mark.</i>

189
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,030
Whoa!

190
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,580
What is this?
l can't see anything.

191
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,830
Frak!

192
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,190
Oh!

193
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,000
Ah! Got you!

194
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,467
- Kat, you got yours?
<i>- Affirmative, Apollo.</i>

195
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,988
<i>Only got eyes for the Chiron.</i>
Relaying coordinates.

196
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:22,907
Squadron, Apollo.
<i>l have Thera Sita.</i>

197
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,588
<i>Relaying jump coordinates</i>
<i>to her right now.</i>

198
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:31,029
Apollo, Starbuck. l got mine.
Frak. l'm just barely holding on here.

199
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:35,309
<i>l lost mine! Has anyone seen Adriatic?</i>
She has lost her jump coordinates.

200
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:38,349
<i>(Helo) Hotdog, negative!</i>
<i>Negative on Adriatic.</i>

201
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:41,027
Hotdog, ease off on the control, man!

202
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:43,185
Ease up with the stick.
It's a Raptor.

203
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,285
Frak it, frak it!

204
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,345
<i>Apollo, it's Galactica actual.</i>

205
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:59,028
<i>You've reached your radiation-dose limit.</i>
<i>You've got to jump.</i>

206
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:01,228
- Count us down.
<i>- (Apollo) Roger that.</i>

207
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:03,668
No! Hold on!
Apollo, please wait.

208
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,868
<i>Hotdog, listen!</i>
<i>We have to get out of here!</i>

209
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:09,628
l can find them!
l can find them! Hold on!

210
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,430
- Please wait!
<i>- (Apollo) Jump on my mark!</i>

211
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,665
<i>- Please, wait!</i>
<i>- (Apollo) One, two...</i>

212
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,948
- No! Please! Wait!
<i>- Mark!</i>

213
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:20,237
<i>(Hotdog) We can't leave without them!</i>
<i>

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,650
Frak! Frak!

215
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,305
Jump complete.

216
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:35,068
DRADIS is back online.
Ship reports moderate hull damage.

217
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:37,827
<i>"Galactica", Apollo.</i>
<i>First trip complete.</i>

218
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,709
Raptors, land your birds
and prepare to jump back...

219
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,699
for the second group of civilians.

220
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,386
<i>We lost the Adriatic.</i>

221
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:55,886
- It's only our first jump.
- Yes, it is.

222
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
<i>(alarm)</i>

223
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,239
<i>Carina, Kat!</i>
Report your location!

224
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,425
Kat, Apollo.
<i>Do you have the Carina?</i>

225
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:23,513
Negative!
Radiation's pissing on my nav.

226
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
l can't see jack!

227
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,278
OK. l found her.

228
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,907
- No! Frak!
<i>- (Apollo) Kat! Kat, report!</i>

229
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,746
Godsdammit!

230
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:43,108
<i>(Apollo) All right, Kat!</i>
<i>Time's up. We're jumping on my mark!</i>

231
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:47,543
<i>- Three, two, one... Mark!</i>
<i>- Godsdammit! The Carina!</i>

232
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,230
l lost...

233
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:54,444
l lost her.

234
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,508
<i>(Apollo) All right. We managed</i>
to get another eight ships through,

235
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:09,194
but we still lost one.

236
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,970
We gotta get better at tracking our sheep.

237
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,714
Quicker reaction times out of the jumps.

238
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,348
Racetrack, don't be calling out
coordinates to the wrong ship.

239
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:25,628
l got mixed up.

240
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:28,467
Keep checking your instruments,
and recheck them.

241
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:31,028
The instruments are crap.

242
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,900
All right.

243
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:40,110
That concludes Outbound Four.

244
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,347
This is Return Four.

245
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:45,947
One to go.

246
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,270
All right, get some rest.

247
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,040
Come on.

248
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,755
Here's the report from the doc.

249
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,670
A hundred marines too weak to work.
Two hundred more are ready to drop.

250
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,906
That's gonna slow down the harvest.

251
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,667
Last batch of passengers
kicked up some trouble.

252
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,187
You... you get these people
to the other side...

253
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:23,027
and they think there's a diner and a chef
waiting to take their order.

254
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:24,177
l know.

255
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:29,387
When they gonna learn they gotta
process the thing first, for frak's sake?

256
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:32,589
Try telling that
to a bunch of empty stomachs.

257
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:36,188
l hear they're still eating paper.
Is that true?

258
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:39,158
No... Paper shortage.

259
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,115
Not a good sign.

260
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,480
No, sir.

261
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,430
So, while you resurrect
do you see the faces of the final five?

262
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,865
The ones that no one's seen.

263
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:46,026
What do you want to know about them?

264
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:48,350
l could be a Cylon.

265
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,775
l would stop being a traitor
to one set of people...

266
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,639
and be a hero to another.

267
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,309
l'd have a place to belong.

268
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,553
You would help me understand my destiny.

269
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,026
- Have you seen my face?
- Your face?

270
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,076
Yes, my face.

271
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,674
Can't remember.

272
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,306
l've been trying to get it all down on paper
while it's still fresh in my mind,

273
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,868
but nothing much comes out.

274
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,475
It's rubbish. l can't remember.

275
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,835
Cylons, humans...

276
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,108
We're all just trying to discover...

277
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,858
who we are.

278
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:49,047
Aren't we?

279
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,660
Hey, Enzo.

280
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,470
Yeah.

281
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,070
l took the name Louanne Katraine
from a girl who died...

282
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,400
two days before the attack on Caprica.

283
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,144
It got me through the background checks.

284
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:26,312
Yeah, times were rough.
Keep going.

285
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,267
l was a drug runner.

286
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,874
Enzo was my supplier.

287
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,108
What do you want? We were truckers,
OK? We just moved stuff.

288
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,258
People?

289
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:53,102
You see, some think that that's the way
that the Cylons infiltrated Caprica.

290
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,309
They seeded themselves in the colonies,
then used criminals...

291
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:59,551
to get them into the capital.

292
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,260
Anyone who's found guilty of helping
the Cylons is considered a traitor.

293
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,468
- We didn't carry Cylons.
- How do you know?

294
00:25:08,568 --> 00:25:14,773
- Cos nobody knew they looked like us.
- Then how do you know you didn't?!

295
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,233
- How do you know?
- You think l'm a traitor?

296
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,629
You think l'm a traitor?

297
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,190
No.

298
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,195
l don't think you're a traitor.

299
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,985
You're a "smart young woman".

300
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,749
That's what the old man said.

301
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:43,099
You're just not smart enough
to accept who you are.

302
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,610
You see, you lied your way
into the company of good people.

303
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,445
Starbuck, don't tell the admiral.

304
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,388
Please... Please don't, or I...

305
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:02,688
Or what?

306
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:07,065
Starbuck, please.
Just let me tell him myself.

307
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,310
Please just let me.

308
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Can you do that?

309
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,910
Gods.

Lines of evolution have buried their fuse...

So this is where you got the idea
to start intentionally downloading.

Gestalt therapy and escape clauses...

318
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,389

Don't touch it!

A mind that burns like a fire.

Yes. l'm here.

Find the hand that lies

In the eye of the husband

Are you all right?

330

It just speaks nonsense,

00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,350
"The eye of the..."

334
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,190
Hera.

335
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,757
Hera is sometimes referred to
as "cow-eyed Hera".

336
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,509
- And the husband of Hera...
- Is Jupiter.

337
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:35,794
The Eye of Jupiter.
That's written about in the ancient texts.

338
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,790
Oh, gods.

339
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:43,185
Could there be a connection
between their gods and ours?

340
00:28:43,285 --> 00:28:46,107
What does it mean?

341
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:48,585
It's a location.

342
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:53,950
A planet hidden in the shadow of light -
probably a cluster of stars.

343
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,450
That will lead us to the Eye of Jupiter.

344
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,266
And to the hand...

345
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,426
"hidden in the shadow of light".

346
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:08,586
It's probably some type of artefact.

347
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,850
A hand.

348
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
As in five.

349
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Five faces.

350
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,720
Now all we have to do
is find the right planet...

351
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
the right star cluster.

352
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,509
Accept who you are.

353
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,510
<i>Accept who you are.</i>

354
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,910
Yeah.

355
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,185
Remember me?

356
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:48,035
Yeah.

357
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,347
Yeah, l remember you.

358
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:54,788
Thieving bastard.

359
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:58,026
You'll ruin everything l've got.

360
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:00,126
Come here.

361
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,429
<i>Faru Sadin, report your location.</i>

362
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:06,909
<i>Kat! You got Faru Sadin?</i>

363
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,700
<i>Kat, have you got "Faru Sadin"? Kat?</i>

364
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,199
<i>Kat, report.</i>

365
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,189
Negative.

366
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:20,039
Kat.

367
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,070
<i>Frak! l've lost the Faru Sadin.</i>

368
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:28,306
Sir. Escalating damage reports,
ship-wide.

369
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:31,386
Engineers are reporting
a cascade of pressure failures.

370
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:34,546
Jump spot's become unstable.
We gotta get out of here.

371
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:37,281
- Open line.
<i>- (Hoshi) Aye, sir.</i>

372
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,587
Channel open.

373
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:41,948
<i>Apollo, Galactica actual.</i>

374
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:43,307
Jump all.

375
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:45,269
<i>Repeat, jump all.</i>

376
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:50,299
All right, admiral's calling it.
Everyone, jump on my mark.

377
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,795
- l'm not losing another one.
- Three, two, one... Mark!

378
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,351
Apollo, Starbuck.
l don't see Kat.

379
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,010
Report.

380
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,266
<i>We're missing Faru Sadin and one Raptor.</i>

381
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:33,948
It's Kat. She must have missed the order.
She's still out there.

382
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:34,798
Damn.

383
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,550
<i>Faru Sadin, this is Kat.</i>
Report your location.

384
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,590
Frak!

385
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,917
<i>(Tigh) Come on, kid.</i>
Come on home.

386
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,665
<i>(Hoshi) It's them!</i>

387
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:47,638
She brought 'em home!

388
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,665
<i>Galactica, Kat.</i>

389
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:54,765
Mission accomplished.

390
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,405
- They said you wanted to see me.
<i>- (weakly) Yeah.</i>

391
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,227
l don't think we should end
the way we ended.

392
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,327
Listen, um...

393
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,396
everybody is...

394
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,955
Everybody is stuck...
with the things that they're not proud of.

395
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,515
And that, uh...
that thing about "good people", I, uh...

396
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,070
l didn't mean that.

397
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,516
Yeah, l know.

398
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,430
Here.

399
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:36,713
Take these. Sleeping pills.

400
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,810
Enough.

401
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,840
So, uh... take them if you want.

402
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,820
Thank you.

403
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,390
l got to go.

404
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,386
Admiral, I...

405
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:10,755
l know. l'm... l'm sorry.

406
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,668
l'm not here to lecture.

407
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,308
l'm letting you know about a promotion.

408
00:37:20,408 --> 00:37:22,868
l'm making you CAG again.

409
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,905
Sir, you know
l'm not getting out of here, right?

410
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:30,275
But you earned it.

411
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,149
What you did
was harder than facing a bullet,

412
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:39,394
and you did it without
putting one other soul in harm's way.

413
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,585
l don't know if l could've done that.

414
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,425
l wish there was
something more l could give.

415
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:47,275
No.

416
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,685
It's good.

417
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,146
l would like to be CAG very much.

418
00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:56,746
Thank you.

419
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,908
Listen... There's a...

420
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,670
There's a thing...

421
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,130
a reason why
you might not want to do this.

422
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,469
Kara knows what it is...

423
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,907
but l wanted to tell you myself.

424
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:26,349
l don't need to know anything
other than what l already know.

425
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:29,309
When you were CAG,

426
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,545
you protected your people,

427
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:34,960
made them feel safe enough to be brave.

428
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,815
What you were gonna say
doesn't change that.

429
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,072
Are you... staying?

430
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,480
Oh, l'm staying.

431
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,794
l love this sickbay, in a way.

432
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,197
It reminds me of
where my son Zak was born.

433
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,478
Carolanne was so happy.

434
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,500
She was convinced,

435
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:28,956
both times,
that she was having a girl.

436
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,588
So it was a surprise at the end.

437
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:36,319
Did you want a girl, too?

438
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,950
Yeah.

439
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:43,509
Three's a good round number.

440
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,427
l need your verdict on this one.
What if?

441
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:55,527
- l hate it.
- Ah.
