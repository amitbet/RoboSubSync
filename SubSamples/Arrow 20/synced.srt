1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,682
My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:05,364
For five years,
I was stranded on an island,

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,700
with only one goal:

4
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:08,951
Survive.

5
00:00:08,953 --> 00:00:10,769
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,988
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,457
to use the list
of names he left me,

8
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:18,460
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

9
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:21,130
To do this, I must
become someone else.

10
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:25,217
I must become something else.

11
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,485
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:27,836
So you met up
with the Hood guy?

13
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:30,522
He's contacted me before.

14
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,676
You're a murderer.

15
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:35,444
You were my best
friend in life,

16
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,813
but now it's like I don't
even know you.

17
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:39,014
I quit.

18
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:41,183
Listen, Lyla, Lawton
is a very dangerous man.

19
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:42,268
What do you
know about him?

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,686
That's everything
you need to locate

21
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:45,654
who's giving
Deadshot his targets.

22
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:47,472
This Lawton kick
his dog or something?

23
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:48,974
He killed
his brother.

24
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,659
I can't move on
with my life

25
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,044
knowing that he's
still out there.

26
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,829
I thought if anybody
got that it'd be you.

27
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:56,081
You two have
unfinished business.

28
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,167
Where do we start?

29
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:03,422
You feel better?

30
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:05,541
I'll feel better
once we end Deadshot.

31
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:15,768
Welcome to Germany,
Mr. Ambassador.

32
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,802
Good to see you.

33
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:18,354
Henrik, you're
looking great.

34
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,614
We have to end this guy
before he makes any

35
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,639
more widows out of wives.

36
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:47,883
We will.

37
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:49,835
Diggle, we'll stop him.

38
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:51,503
I promised you I'd
help take him down,

39
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:52,671
and I keep
my promises,

40
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:54,673
but he's on
another continent.

41
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:56,541
Not anymore.

42
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:59,378
I thought it would
be helpful to track

43
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,047
A.R.G.U.S' manhunt for
Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot,

44
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,883
so I decrypted their
communication logs.

45
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:08,103
Which means, I just
hacked a federal agency.

46
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:09,938
Which kind of makes
me a cyber-terrorist,

47
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,690
which is bad because
I really don't see myself

48
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:13,158
fitting in well
at Guantanamo Bay.

49
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,560
Don't worry, Felicity,
they don't send blondes there.

50
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,029
I dye it, actually.

51
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:18,781
I keep your secret...
Hey, what'd you find?

52
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:21,100
Deadshot is
scheduled to meet

53
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:23,452
with a potential new client
here in Starling City.

54
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:26,338
Except the potential
contract is bogus.

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,096
Your friend Lyla is
setting a trap for him.

56
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,709
Lawton took the bait.

57
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,710
Great, I'll talk to Lyla,

58
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,428
see if I can
suss out any details.

59
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,429
Good.

60
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:36,348
I've got to have
lunch with Laurel.

61
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,967
So when did you become,
uh, lunch dates with Laurel?

62
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:41,987
Look, we're just...

63
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,806
We're friends.

64
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:46,725
Friends are good.
But?

65
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:50,029
Couldn't you be friends with
someone less complicated

66
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,531
than your ex-girlfriend,
who's your ex-best friend's

67
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,383
current girlfriend?

68
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,235
I wear a hood and I put
arrows into criminals,

69
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:58,770
so when it comes
to complexity...

70
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:01,606
I grade on a curve.

71
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:08,997
Rescuing your father
and stopping Fyers

72
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:11,166
is not going to be
some walk in the park.

73
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:12,384
They're not
going to allow us

74
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:13,886
to just stroll on
into their camp.

75
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:16,288
Which is why
we'll need cover.

76
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,591
If both of us are infiltrating,
who'll provide that?

77
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,093
He will.

78
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:23,595
Me?

79
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:27,232
The assault
rifle is flushed.

80
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,350
It's useless.

81
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:31,186
We have a bow,
arrows.

82
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:32,938
And no one capable
of shooting them.

83
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,139
No offense, kid.

84
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:35,991
I was going to say
the same thing.

85
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:41,747
I think we should be spending
our time trying to devise a plan,

86
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:44,649
not lower our already
slim chances of survival.

87
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:46,418
He'll hit his
mark by sundown.

88
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,171
If not,
we'll do it your way.

89
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:55,094
Lyla!

90
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:56,512
What is it,
Johnnie?

91
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:57,963
Just came by to see
how things were going

92
00:03:57,965 --> 00:03:59,765
on your Deadshot investigation.
Anything new come up?

93
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:00,933
Funnily enough,
it did.

94
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:03,185
I was curious why
you, a bodyguard,

95
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:04,503
were so keen on
taking down

96
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,171
such a high profile
assassin,

97
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:08,006
so I did some
reading up on Lawton.

98
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,141
Lyla, listen...

99
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:10,609
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out

100
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:11,894
that he killed
your brother?

101
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,529
That you were
using me--me!

102
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:16,031
To what? Draw him
into the open

103
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,150
so you could take
him down yourself?

104
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:19,785
I will not let you
use my agency

105
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,487
to settle
your blood feud.

106
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,322
Lyla...

107
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:25,240
I need to see
this guy in a bag.

108
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:26,992
You of all people
should get that.

109
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,194
Get this--stay away
from Lawton, Johnnie,

110
00:04:29,196 --> 00:04:31,363
or so help me, I will
have you arrested.

111
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:33,966
You doubt me?

112
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,636
Never have.

113
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,387
Hi.
Did you get my voicemail?

114
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:56,522
No.

115
00:04:56,524 --> 00:04:58,273
Things got a little
crazy around here--

116
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,558
back to back
meetings...

117
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,410
I am so sorry,
rain check?

118
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:02,661
Sure.

119
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:05,080
I could definitely catch up
on some club paperwork.

120
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,032
We're way behind
since Tommy left.

121
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:09,618
I'm still shocked that he
went to go work for Malcolm.

122
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,670
You know, you were
really understanding

123
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:13,038
to let him take
this opportunity.

124
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,790
Tommy said
you were cool with it.

125
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,176
Why wouldn't I be?
He's my friend. Like you.

126
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:18,910
I'm sorry,
are we early?

127
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:21,296
No, not at all.

128
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:22,714
Uh, Oliver,
this is Eric Moore

129
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,383
and his wife, Nancy.

130
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:26,418
I'm prepping them
for a deposition for tomorrow.

131
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,389
And this must be
your bodyguard?

132
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:32,591
This is our son, Taylor.

133
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:33,976
Well, you are in
very capable hands.

134
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:36,028
It was nice
to meet you.

135
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,697
Eric, Nancy,

136
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,401
I want to make sure that
you guys are up for this.

137
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:45,270
Edward Rasmus isn't known
for playing with kid gloves,

138
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:47,039
so this could
get rough.

139
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,125
We invested our entire life savings
with Rasmus and he stole it.

140
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:51,443
Our retirement.

141
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:53,078
Taylor's college fund.

142
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,581
He stole our future, Ms. Lance.

143
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,549
We want it back.

144
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:59,384
Well, then
let's go get it.

145
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,460
Hello?

146
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:11,446
Mr. Moore? I have some
documents for you from Ms. Lance

147
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:13,432
related to tomorrow's
deposition.

148
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:21,607
What a nice home
you have here.

149
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:24,526
You can really...

150
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:25,944
Feel the love.

151
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:36,588
Sorry about the mess.

152
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,592
This works better
if it looks like a break-in.

153
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:52,054
Ah!

154
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:18,013
Is it done?
The parents, yes.

155
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,966
I'm afraid there's been a variable.
The child got away.

156
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:22,367
Got away?

157
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:24,086
Did he see you?

158
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:25,637
No, Mr. Rasmus.

159
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,272
What he saw was
the face of the man

160
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:30,392
who will reunite him
with his parents.

161
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:37,649
Starling City
is expected to be host

162
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,184
of this year's Festival
of Lights exhibition.

163
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:42,270
In other news, the bodies
of Mr. and Mrs. Moore

164
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:44,222
were found early this morning.

165
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,657
The couple were
being represented

166
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:48,076
by attorney Laurel Lance of CNRI

167
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:51,947
in a lawsuit against
financier Edward Rasmus.

168
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,916
Miraculously, their
seven-year-old son Taylor

169
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:57,619
survived the horrific attack.

00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:12,264
This isn't your fault, Laurel,
you shouldn't feel guilty.

173
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,750
I don't feel guilty.
I'm angry.

174
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:16,919
This wasn't some
random break-in.

175
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,921
Edward Rasmus is
involved, I know it.

176
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:20,773
Ok, listen, our guys
are looking into this.

177
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:22,107
But you need
to stay out of it, ok?

178
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:23,859
Because if Rasmus
is behind this,

179
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:25,477
he's clearly not
messing around.

180
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,229
Uh...

181
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:29,231
If you'd like to say
good-bye to Taylor,

182
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,867
I will be taking him
over to child services.

183
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:33,485
Doesn't he have
any other family?

184
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:35,571
Grandparents
are in Melbourne.

185
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,489
We're tracking them
down, but until then,

186
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:40,259
he's going to be a temporary ward
of the state.

187
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,078
He can stay with me.

188
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,165
As his attorney,
I am assigning myself

189
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,300
temporary guardianship.

190
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,785
You'd still need
a judge's order.

191
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,553
I'll have it to you in an hour.

192
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:54,840
Well, have it
your way.

193
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:57,210
Ok, look, I'm going
to park a patrol car

194
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,395
outside your place.

195
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:00,446
Fine.
And you...

196
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:02,147
You look after
them, all right?

197
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,917
I spend most nights at
your daughter's anyways.

198
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,603
There was probably
a better time to tell you that.

199
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,855
Probably not.

200
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:15,861
Hey, come stay
in my house, ok?

201
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,914
What are you doing here?
I heard what happened,

202
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,083
I just wanted to make sure
Laurel was ok.

203
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:22,835
You could have
just called.

204
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:25,287
I met Laurel's clients
and their son yesterday

205
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,522
and I felt badly.

206
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,323
You met them?

207
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:31,326
Yeah, when I was picking
up Laurel for lunch...

208
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,998
Which she didn't tell you about.

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,166
Tell you what?

210
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,601
Nothing.

211
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:41,503
It's settled.

212
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:44,106
Taylor's coming
home with us tonight.

213
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,508
Well,
if you need anything--

214
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:47,175
we're fine.
Ok.

215
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:49,011
We should really
get going.

216
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:50,813
Here.

217
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:01,189
Set your sight.

218
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,011
Hit the tree.

219
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:12,851
Probably hit a tree.

220
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:17,873
Set your sight.

221
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,809
Hit the tree.

222
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,181
Steady your anchor point.

223
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:38,226
I hope
you're getting closer...

224
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:40,412
At teaching him how
to be a better marksman.

225
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:43,615
It's not as though our lives
depend on it or anything.

226
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:48,253
Try again.
Ok.

227
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,209
What's this?

228
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,295
Lyla's mission
profile on the trap

229
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:57,596
they've set
for Deadshot.

230
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,381
Lawton is set
to meet his new employer

231
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:01,600
and get his assignment
tomorrow at 8 pm.

232
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:04,219
Only, his
new employer...

233
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:06,271
Will be an
A.R.G.U.S. agent.

234
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:08,557
Lyla will then
swoop in with her team

235
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,977
and arrest him.

236
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:14,863
Do you want
Lawton arrested?

237
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:22,154
No.

238
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:25,941
Then tomorrow night, we cross
Floyd Lawton's name off your list.

239
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,997
There is something else
we need to look into.

240
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,382
Two of Laurel's clients
were murdered last night.

241
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:35,134
Their seven-year-old
son barely escaped.

242
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:36,668
That's terrible.

243
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,570
Edward Rasmus,

244
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,789
the financial advisor
Laurel was taking to court,

245
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,392
may not have pulled the trigger,
but he probably called in the hit.

246
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:46,495
I want you to get into
his corporate accounts,

247
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,398
phone records, anything that
may link him to the killer, ok?

248
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:53,902
Where
are you going?

249
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:55,771
Laurel's.

250
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:57,489
Another
friendly meal?

251
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:59,808
My daughter is
secure at her place?

252
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,160
So far, all quiet...

253
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:04,446
All right, let me know
if there is any movement.

254
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:07,116
I'm heading over there
right now.

255
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:09,084
What did you steal this time?

256
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:10,919
You got a minute?
No.

257
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:14,206
It's about the Hood.

258
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,663
When my men found you
on that subway car

259
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:17,660
after you were kidnapped,

260
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:19,878
you told them you didn't know
anything about the vigilante.

261
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,513
So there's something
you forgot to tell them?

262
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,065
No.

263
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,499
I just want to see
him brought

264
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,518
to justice like
everyone else.

265
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,270
Don't worry, kid.
We'll get him.

266
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:31,557
Just keep making sure
I don't have a reason to get you.

267
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:39,181
Taylor?
Sweetheart?

268
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:40,949
Are you hungry?

269
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:43,085
You know, I make
the world's best

270
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,204
macaroni and cheese.

271
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:48,607
It's the only thing
she knows how to make.

272
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:51,310
I miss my mom and dad.

273
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:04,506
When I was your age,

274
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:06,658
my mom tucked me into bed

275
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,161
that night before going out.

276
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,946
Then the next thing I knew,

277
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:14,016
there was a police officer
at my door.

278
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:17,236
He said that she was gone

279
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:21,573
and that I would never see her again.
But you know what?

280
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:23,325
He was wrong.

281
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,277
You saw her?
Mh-mmm.

282
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,281
Every time I close
my eyes, I can see her.

283
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:31,233
Every time I go to bed,

284
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,585
I see her in my dreams.

285
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,587
Really?

286
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,739
Yeah.

287
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,908
Now try it,
close your eyes.

288
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,565
I see them.

289
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,622
Whenever you are sad,

290
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,891
or scared,

291
00:13:55,893 --> 00:14:00,229
just remember that
they will always be there.

292
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,517
You constantly
surprise me, Merlyn.

293
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:10,355
I'll get it.

294
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:13,125
Ms. Lance?

295
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,661
Lieutenant Kessel, SCPD.

296
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:18,446
Your dad asked me
to check in.

297
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:22,084
Lieutenant, can you hold your
badge up to the door, please?

298
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,092
Ok, great.

299
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,794
Just one sec.

300
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,179
What?

301
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,564
His badge number
begins with a zero,

302
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:36,682
Lieutenant's badge
numbers begin with a one--

303
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:19,841
It was the badge that
gave me away, right?

304
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,344
You know,
my father's a cop.

305
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,848
And that's not
all he taught me.

306
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,417
I'm feeling like it might
be time for you to move.

307
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:07,927
Dad, whoever
Rasmus hired

308
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:10,311
is going to keep coming until
he finishes the job,

309
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:12,931
otherwise Rasmus will just
hire someone else who will.

310
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:15,567
Ok, listen,
I want the three of you

311
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:17,902
in protective custody immediately,
and don't even think about it.

312
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,737
He killed two of my men.

313
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:21,656
The Hood just
saved our lives.

314
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:24,025
We can trust him.

315
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:25,693
He won't let
anything happen to me.

316
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,111
Even if I was
comfortable

317
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,330
with the idea of him
watching over you 24/7,

318
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:30,865
which I'm not,

319
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:33,685
something tells me he's
got better things to do.

320
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:36,187
What about Oliver?

321
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:37,722
Sorry, you got another
friend named Oliver?

322
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,824
The Queens have more
security than the President.

323
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:43,044
They've got cameras everywhere,
bodyguards in every wing,

324
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:46,848
and no one goes in or out
without being accounted for.

325
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,417
We both only want
what is best for Laurel.

326
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,654
And right now that is
to stay close to Oliver.

327
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:54,022
Trust me.

328
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:09,604
This is
Mr. Robbins.

329
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:12,457
Where you go,
he goes.

330
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,292
You'll be very well
protected, Ms. Lance.

331
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,276
Thank you.

332
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:16,578
I hand-selected
these men myself.

333
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,713
The house and the grounds
are completely secure.

334
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:21,115
Please make
yourself at home.

335
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:23,218
You must be Taylor.

336
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,087
How about I show you where
I hide the good cookies?

337
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,289
Ok?

338
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:31,759
Mr. Queen, whenever
you're ready,

339
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,562
I can take you to your next
appointment, sir.

340
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:35,813
The Lawton meeting?

341
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:37,148
Yes.

342
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,799
I just need to
swing by the club

343
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,801
and pick up
my good suit.

344
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,153
So, I'll meet you
there.

345
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:44,472
Of course, sir.

346
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:46,241
You're leaving?

347
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:48,726
There's something else I need
to take care of. It's important.

348
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:50,578
More important than
what's going on here?

349
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,480
No offense to Oliver,
but I think we need

350
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:55,283
Mr. Robbins and his men
more than him.

351
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,707
You are the reason
why we're here,

352
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,043
and trust me,
that wasn't easy to admit.

353
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:06,594
You'll be fine.

354
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:08,546
I promise.

355
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,945
You know, chewing might help.

356
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:26,847
Hmm. Not dainty
enough for you?

357
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:30,034
I could eat you under
the table, Roy Harper.

358
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:31,686
Don't forget that.

359
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:34,489
All units,
code 10-80.

360
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:36,157
Starling City port,
10-80...

361
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,492
What is that?

362
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:39,243
Suspected
vigilante activity,

363
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:40,695
requesting
all available units.

364
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:43,047
Do you have a police
radio in your pocket?

365
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:45,133
No, I'm just
happy to see you.

366
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:46,501
Got to run.

367
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:14,829
I think you've got something
that belongs to me.

368
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:17,231
You set this up,
just to get your radio back?

369
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,899
Well...

370
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,201
I do love
that radio.

371
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:22,620
Come on.

372
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,207
I'm uploading
a satellite overview

373
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,425
of the Plaza
to your phone...

374
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:28,710
Thanks,
but I know the place--

375
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:30,795
Dig was pretty specific
about where you should perch--

376
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,597
you know,

377
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,716
what position gives you
the best shot at Lawton.

378
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,300
I think.

379
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:38,419
He used a lot
of military jargon.

380
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:40,471
So you're sniping a sniper.

381
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:42,774
Kind of ironic, don't you think?

382
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:46,260
Me neither.

383
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:47,528
What's that?

384
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,263
I had a remote access trojan

385
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:51,232
scouring the Internet
for Edward Rasmus.

386
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:53,100
His name just popped up
on a flight manifest,

387
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:54,769
8:15 to Shanghai...
He's running.

388
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:56,604
That's good, right?

389
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,857
If he's leaving town, he won't be
after Laurel and the child anymore.

390
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,796
But if you did
want to stop him,

391
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,215
looks like
it's now or never.

392
00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:10,134
Deadshot or Rasmus...
Your choice.

393
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:32,473
Trap one,
this is Harbinger.

394
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,308
Wait for Lawton
to enter and make contact.

395
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,244
Then we'll
take him down.

396
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,164
Damn it, Oliver...

397
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:04,055
...Just until
this CNRI mess dies down.

398
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:06,274
And if it doesn't,
two best things about China--

399
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:08,175
wontons and no
extradition treaty.

400
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,812
Hey, hey, I thought
I was paying you extra

401
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:12,480
not to stop at the reds.

402
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:34,535
Trap one, possible
target acquisition.

403
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:41,092
Get ready.

404
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:52,487
Stand down.

405
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:57,558
Maybe Lawton didn't
take the bait after all.

406
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:18,746
We're blown! Take cover!

407
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:56,384
On your knees.
On your knees.

408
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,956
Hands behind your head.

409
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,759
I saw you coming a mile away.

410
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:06,761
Thanks for tipping me off.

411
00:23:06,763 --> 00:23:08,963
I'll kill you for what
you did to Andy.

412
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:10,414
I'd be pulling
these triggers right now,

413
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,132
except there's
nobody paying me.

414
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:17,905
There's space
for you right here,

415
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:19,657
right next to your brother.

416
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:23,110
You'd do best to remember that.

417
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:46,679
What happened?

418
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:50,784
You didn't show,
things didn't go well.

419
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:53,153
Rasmus was
skipping town...

420
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:54,871
And I had to
reprioritize.

421
00:23:54,873 --> 00:23:58,058
Thanks to your new priorities
four agents are dead, Oliver.

422
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:00,827
You could have
stopped this guy,

423
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:04,030
ended this maniac
once and for all.

424
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:05,915
Lawton got away?

425
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:08,668
You seriously think

426
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,553
a man who goes by
the name "Deadshot"

427
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:12,589
was going down
without a fight?

428
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:14,057
I needed you
there, man.

429
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,592
Taylor Moore was
relying on me, Diggle.

430
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:16,893
But this was
never about that kid,

431
00:24:16,895 --> 00:24:20,430
he is safe under armed
security at your house.

432
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:21,848
This is about Laurel.

433
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,267
Diggle, I made a choice.

434
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:25,685
I know.

435
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:27,520
You chose Laurel.

436
00:24:27,522 --> 00:24:30,223
Always her.

437
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:32,709
Everybody else
be damned.

438
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:44,921
Something to say, Felicity?

439
00:24:44,923 --> 00:24:47,407
Nothing you
want to hear.

440
00:24:56,884 --> 00:24:59,519
Try again.

441
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,227
You're thinking too much.

442
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:10,113
Nobody ever accused
me of that before.

443
00:25:18,823 --> 00:25:20,040
Show-off.

444
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:23,243
I see my target
in the distance,

445
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:26,279
I feel the variation
in the wind,

446
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:29,132
I hear the bowstring tighten...

447
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:30,500
And I let go.

448
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:33,953
Give in to your senses...

449
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:36,172
Don't think.

450
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,410
You're right,

451
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:58,978
this is definitively
not the time or place...

452
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,948
No, it's--no,
it's just there's, uh...

453
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:05,285
Someone.

454
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:08,088
And it's a mile
past complicated,

455
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,706
but I can't.

456
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,342
Does she know
how much you love her?

457
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:18,131
I suspect right
now she doesn't.

458
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,786
But as soon as
I'm home, she will.

459
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:29,342
You looked
so beautiful that night.

460
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:33,396
I remember Oliver
telling me once

461
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:35,982
that he wished
your father

462
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:38,368
would let him come over
to your house more often.

463
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,120
That being there

464
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:42,122
made him feel less
like Robert Queen's son

465
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:45,158
and more like himself.

466
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,961
I liked who my son was
when he was around you.

467
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:50,713
Thank you.

468
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:53,032
Hey.

469
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:54,700
The police just called.

470
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:56,702
Edward Rasmus
was arrested.

471
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:00,590
Really? What happened?

472
00:27:00,592 --> 00:27:03,259
Apparently he confessed
to everything.

473
00:27:03,261 --> 00:27:04,978
He's going to go to prison
for a long time

474
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,563
and won't be able
to hurt anyone ever again.

475
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:08,097
Why would he confess?

476
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:12,519
The vigilante
was involved.

477
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:13,937
Good for him.

478
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,408
So, I guess it's over.

479
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,410
Yes...Yeah.

480
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:21,494
Great, I'll go
wake up Taylor--

481
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:23,163
No, Tommy, please.

482
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,748
He's sleeping,
he's been through a lot.

483
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,700
Now you all are
welcome to stay.

484
00:27:27,702 --> 00:27:29,953
We certainly
have enough room.

485
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,290
It's your call.

486
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:38,344
Thank you, Mrs. Queen.

487
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:40,597
I guess we'll stay, then.

488
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,298
Good.

489
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,757
Your lawyer's here.

490
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:55,144
It's you.

491
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,148
I'd like to discuss
loose ends.

492
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,734
You didn't get my message?

493
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:05,121
Forget about the Moore boy.

494
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:07,874
I've already confessed,
that freakshow in a hood

495
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:09,492
told me he'd kill me
if I didn't.

496
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:12,712
We need to make
this meeting appear legitimate.

497
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:14,163
Lawyer stuff.

498
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,417
Sign here, please.

499
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:20,420
Am I clear?
You leave the boy alone.

500
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,139
I wish I could,

501
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:24,591
but he's seen
my face.

502
00:28:24,593 --> 00:28:26,426
Just like you.

503
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:32,515
If you put pressure in just the
right areas above the forearm,

504
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:35,685
like I did to you,
an embolism will form

505
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:38,238
in the medial
antebrachial vein.

506
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,806
When the air pocket
reaches your heart in,

507
00:28:40,808 --> 00:28:42,909
give or take,
fifteen seconds,

508
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:47,280
you'll die.
It's relatively painless.

509
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:48,781
Oh...

510
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:51,634
Nothing personal.

511
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:53,753
We're done here!

512
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,441
Excuse me, hi,
I'm looking for my boyfriend,

513
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:17,977
he's kind of a regular
around here.

514
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:19,529
Piercing blue eyes,

515
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:22,065
and may or may not have
stolen a police radio.

516
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,150
Yeah, that's him.
Behind you.

517
00:29:29,523 --> 00:29:31,958
Well, that's
a nice look.

518
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,026
What were you
thinking?

519
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:36,462
Well, if it
isn't the wonder twins...

520
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:38,247
He's very sorry
for stealing the radio,

521
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:41,325
and he won't ever
bug you or steal anything

522
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,636
from you guys ever again.

523
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:44,804
Both of you.
Come with me.

524
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:50,727
What are we
doing here?

525
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:52,878
Well, your boyfriend
is so interested in the Hood,

526
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,764
I thought he might
like to meet someone else

527
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:56,899
who already made
his acquaintance.

528
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:58,935
Oh, God...

529
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:04,040
Who was he?

530
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:06,576
Well, that's the thing.
When you're alive, you get a name.

531
00:30:06,578 --> 00:30:09,529
When you wind up down
here, you get a number.

532
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:11,664
Meet 26.

533
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,449
See, your pal the Hood,

534
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:17,620
he's already sent
26 stiffs down here

535
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:22,074
since he started
his little one-man...

536
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:23,543
War.

537
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:25,378
Maybe this guy deserved it.
Maybe he did.

538
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,131
But that's not
how justice works.

539
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:30,533
You see, the vigilante,

540
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,935
he doesn't have to answer
to anyone but himself,

541
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:36,205
and that's a very dangerous power
to give to any one man.

542
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:37,857
He saved my life.

543
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:43,613
And how do you know tomorrow
he won't just as easily take it?

544
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,367
Get out of here.

545
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:49,101
Let's go.

546
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:20,066
He's safe now, Laurel.

547
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:23,436
With a hard road ahead of him.

548
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:27,273
Well, he's lucky
to have you in his life.

549
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:31,527
I know the feeling.

550
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:36,582
When you first got home,

551
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:39,769
I didn't think
that you changed much.

552
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:42,505
But you have, and...

553
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:45,925
It's nice to see.

554
00:31:47,044 --> 00:31:49,712
Thank you.

555
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:01,340
I have a delivery
van coming in for Ms. Lance,

556
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:02,775
his I.D. checks out.

557
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,644
Thanks for
the heads up.

558
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:12,902
For...Ms. Lance.

559
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:26,032
What a beautiful home.

560
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:34,335
Hmm...

561
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:36,119
Such pain here.

562
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,704
A sense of loss and regret,

563
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,289
you can feel it,

564
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,458
down to the wood paneling...

565
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,334
Tommy...

566
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,803
Can you two stay
here with Taylor?

567
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,554
Where are you going?
It's an old house,

568
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,773
fuses blow all the time,
it's probably nothing,

569
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,675
just please...

570
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,744
Come on.
Ok.

571
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,217
He's here.

572
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,921
Where's the child?

573
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,589
This house is quite large

574
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,208
and I don't particularly
care to check every room.

575
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,810
Very well.

576
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:36,513
Have it your way.

577
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:00,787
Laurel...
Laurel, don't--

578
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,422
No, Ollie is
still out there.

579
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,777
What happened to you
on that island?

580
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,246
You're about
to find out.

581
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,697
Death by poker.

582
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,950
That's a new one.

583
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,501
He was going
to shoot me.

584
00:35:21,503 --> 00:35:22,953
And then, uh, mister...

585
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,789
Robbins, he grabbed
the poker and...

586
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,290
saved my life.

587
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:32,462
Mr. Robbins
was a real hero.

588
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,831
If it weren't for him,
we'd all be dead.

589
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,267
I've got enough
details for my report.

590
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,220
I'll clear my boys
out of here.

591
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,524
Let's go.

592
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,959
You still love her.
Don't you?

593
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,661
It doesn't matter
how I feel.

594
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,414
Because of what I do...

595
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,417
I could never be with her.

596
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,052
You see, you don't have
anything to be afraid of.

597
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:14,537
She is never...

598
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,391
ever going to know my secret.

599
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,594
It doesn't matter
if she knows.

600
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,862
I know.

601
00:36:21,864 --> 00:36:24,014
And I don't know
how to be with Laurel

602
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,850
knowing
the entire time...

603
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,937
that if she ever found
out who you really are...

604
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,058
she would choose you.

605
00:36:48,516 --> 00:36:51,066
Thank you for everything you
tried to do for Eric and Nancy.

606
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:53,940
And for keeping Taylor safe.

607
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:57,167
Come here.

608
00:37:01,673 --> 00:37:04,508

Wait. We both almost

made me realize I don't.

00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,800
You're lying.

Yeah,

Look, I don't
understand this, Roy.

649
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:54,652
Why is finding the Hood
so important to you?

650
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:58,306
I can't stop replaying
that night in my head.

651
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:02,110
The night I got kidnapped
by that psycho, I just...

652
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:04,279
I thought I was
going to die.

653
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:06,965
But you didn't.
Yeah, because of him.

654
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:08,483
You don't owe him anything.

655
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:11,869
You're wrong,
I owe him everything.

656
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:15,790
And I can't go back to the way
things were, Thea,

657
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,626
I can't just go back
to being nothing.

658
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:19,794
You're the one
that keeps telling me

659
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:22,013
that I can be better
than who I am, and this...

660
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:25,300
This is my chance to be.

661
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:28,553
I can't explain it, but...

662
00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:32,273
It feels like my life
is connected to his.

663
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:38,229
♪ Rise up like the sun
and labor till the work...♪

664
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:41,349
So let's find him.

665
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:45,870
I can tell this means
the world to you.

666
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:49,073
And you mean
the world to me.

667
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:52,960
So let's find him.

668
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:55,413
You and me.

669
00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:58,049
Vigilante, here we come.

670
00:40:10,596 --> 00:40:13,564
Was hoping you'd be here.

671
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,402
I want us to get back
on the same page.

672
00:40:17,404 --> 00:40:20,554
Oliver, we're not
even in the same book,

673
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:23,191
you and me, not anymore.

674
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:28,262
I just did what
I thought I had to.

675
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:31,666
Just like I'm doing
what I have to.

676
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,903
We're done.

677
00:40:37,623 --> 00:40:39,207
Don't do this.

678
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:40,625
The only thing
you have to stop me

679
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:42,794
from going out that door
is an arrow.

680
00:40:47,266 --> 00:40:49,717
Hey.

681
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:56,441
Where's he going?

682
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:09,437
So how did our
Robin Hood do?

683
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:11,906
As expected?

684
00:41:11,908 --> 00:41:14,775
So back to the
drawing board we go.

685
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:23,501
Yao Fei!

686
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:25,803
Ba!

687
00:41:33,011 --> 00:41:35,396
How did you escape?

688
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:38,065
I didn't.

689
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,858
You son of a bitch...

690
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,193
Hey!

691
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:57,001

island is at an end.
