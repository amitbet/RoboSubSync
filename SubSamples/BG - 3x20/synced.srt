<i>- (Adama) This is it.
- That's it, the lonian Nebula.</i>

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,350
So what do you think we'll find?

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,468
A beacon? A temple?
A signpost to Earth?

5
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:18,466
How many more jumps
before we find the nebula?

6
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:21,190
l'm estimating an even dozen.
We're getting close.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,266
Still no sign of the Cylons.

8

11
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,220
That song.
You don't hear that song?

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,392
It's in the frakkin' ship!

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,670
- This is my son.
- l am very sorry, but l am not responsible.

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,746
No. He's sick and l want you to bless him.

15
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:45,346
Bless him?

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,147
You are saying that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,

17
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:53,785
ordered your execution
and the execution of 200 other people?

18
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:55,866
That's exactly what l'm saying.

19
00:00:55,966 --> 00:01:00,984
This is a death warrant. Have you seen
the names on this list? Do you have...

20
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:03,428
Gaius Baltar chose to
side with the Cylons...

21
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:07,145
and to actively seek the deaths
of his fellow citizens.

22
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:10,466
Madam President, are you taking
chamalla at this time?

23
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:13,024
Don't answer.
l'm putting a stop to this now.

24
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:16,580
If she is on drugs,
it goes to her credibility as a witness.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,038
l am taking chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,318
l'm calling you a liar and a coward.
And for what?

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,865
The traitorous piece of garbage
Gaius Baltar...

28
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:34,770
who doesn't even deserve a trial.

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,700
l will not serve under a man
who questions my integrity.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,432
And l won't have an officer under
my command who doesn't have any.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,110
Argh!

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,627

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,340
Yeah, l'm fine. l just cut myself.
How are you doing?

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,628
l don't wanna face them.

40
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:50,228

Uh, l think l stopped the bleeding.

l think l can give you some volume.</i>

43
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:59,673
OK. All right,

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,810
- Get out of that bed!
- That's not your best shot.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,629
Get your fat, lazy ass
out of that rack, Roslin!

46
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:13,190
Yes, sir. OK, sir.
Anything you say, sir.

What are you talking about?

66

- Mistrial? Whatever for?
- Because we're losing.

67
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:34,988
Not from where l'm standing.
We're actually doing quite well.

We're about to break the prosecution.

And l don't think he's the only one up there.

74

l agree. Our tactical victories

75
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:05,627
Right. So now, because we're winning,
we're losing, actually?

76

Sabotage? With music?

l can't quite understand it myself, but...

148

There's too much confusion.

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,180
They'd already selected the names.

167
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,506
One of them,
l believe it was a Three,

168
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:15,384
gave the list to the president and said:

169
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:19,547
"Here are the people that are going
to be executed. Please sign this."

170
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,309
He looked at the list, he saw
all the names... and then he signed it.

171
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:31,869
Did he protest? l mean, did he argue?
Did he offer any resistance whatsoever?

172
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,870
<i>- (man) Sign it!
- (Baltar) l won't do it.</i>

173
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,186
You're going to have to solve
your consciences some other way.

174
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:42,432
Sign it! Sign your name!
Sign it!

175
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,665
No. He never did.

176
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:50,548
Oh, Felix. Oh, Felix.
What are you doing?

177
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,068
Get that out of my face.

178
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:55,710
- We'll get him in the cross.
- Control your client.

179
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,266
It's no secret. The whole fleet knows this
man tried to stab me through the neck.

180
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,346
And you missed!
Butter fingers!

181
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:07,271
- Sorry, Your Honours.
- No further questions.

182
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,365
Your witness, Counsellor.

183
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,068
<i>- No questions.
- (Baltar) What?!</i>

184
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:35,827
<i>(muttering/gavel bangs)...</i>

185
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:38,225
- What are you?
- Witness is dismissed.

186
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:41,232
<i>(Baltar) Oh! Oh, great.</i>

187
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,386
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's your word against his.

188
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,988
If he's decided to perjure himself,
there's nothing we can do.

189
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:52,743
We're going to have to adjust our strategy.

190
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,185
Is the defence prepared
to present their case?

191
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,380
Your Honours, at this time,
if it please the court...

192
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,670
uh...

193
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:27,628
l would like to offer a motion.

194
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:30,626
The defence would like to move
for a mistrial.

195
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:34,750
No, we do not want a mistrial!
l do not want a mistrial!

196
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,267
<i>(Franks) Gaius Baltar!</i>

197
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:41,107
Behave, Dr Baltar.
On what grounds, Counsellor?

198
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:44,239
On the grounds that one of the panel has...

199
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,587
already prejudged the
outcome of this trial...

200
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:52,188
and determined the guilt of the defendant.

201
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:55,708
That's a very serious charge,
Mr Lampkin.

202
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,608
Which judge?

203
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,855
<i>- That would be you, Admiral.
- (muttering)</i>

204
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:09,349
And to prove it, l need to take the unusual
step of calling Mr Lee Adama to the stand.

205
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,449
<i>(muttering)...</i>

206
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,667
- You've gotta be frakking kidding me!
- This is the only way we're gonna win.

207
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:20,869
- l will not testify against my father.
- That is your choice.

208
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:23,787
Either way,
l'm putting you on the stand.

209
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:29,426
Your Honours, this is completely
improper. Counsel cannot testify at trial.

210
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:34,541
l can cite at least seven precedents
off the top of my head.

211
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,900
- Call your witness, Counsellor.
- Thank you.

212
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,350
Mr Adama.

213
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,309
Mr Adama, did you meet with your father,
Admiral Adama, four days ago?

214
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,550
Yes.

215
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:18,228
At that meeting,
did Admiral Adama express an opinion...

216
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:22,154
as to whether the defendant
deserved a trial?

217
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,787
All l'm looking for is the truth here,
Mr Adama. Let's have it.

218
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:34,589
l'm waiting.

219
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,689
Answer the question.

220
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,787
You swore an oath
as an officer of the court.

221
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,910
If you don't answer the question,
you hold the entire system of justice...

222
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,985
- What frakking system?!
- Mr Adama.

223
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,015
l'm sorry, Your Honours.
Please excuse my associate.

224
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,997
All right, all right.
l'll try something else.

225
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,235
Do you believe that the defendant
deserves a fair trial?

226
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,426
- As a matter of fact, l do.
- Why?

227
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:24,107
Aside from the fact
everyone deserves a fair trial,

228
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:26,627
l also happen to believe
that he is not guilty...

229
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:30,105
Your Honours,
l must insist on an exception here.

230
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:33,426
- He can't testify in this way. It is improper.
- l agree.

231
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:36,469
He can make his argument
in closing statements.

232
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,785
l'm inclined to agree with the prosecution.

233
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,546
Thank you.

234
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,829
You can appeal to the president
if you feel that this influences the verdict,

235
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:47,507
but I, for one,

236
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:50,549
would like to hear this witness testify.

237
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,546
<i>(male judge) l would second that.</i>

238
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:56,791
- Continue.
- Thank you, Your Honours.

239
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,870
Mr Adama?

240
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:02,994
- Mr Adama?
- Yes?

241
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,266
Why do you believe that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,

242
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:12,158
deserves to be acquitted?

243
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,385
Well, because the evidence
does not support the charges.

244
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:18,685
Come on.

245
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,268
Did the defendant make mistakes?

246
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:27,229
Sure, he did.
Serious mistakes.

247
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:32,769
But did he actually commit any crimes?
Did he commit treason? No.

248
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,027
It was an impossible situation. When
the Cylons arrived, what could he do?

249
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:39,425
What could anyone have done?

250
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,549
Ask yourself,
what would you have done?

251
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:44,774
What would you have done?

252
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,549
If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons
would've nuked the planet then and there.

253
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:55,308
So did he appear to cooperate
with the Cylons? Sure.

254
00:20:55,408 --> 00:21:01,273
So did hundreds of others. What's
the difference between him and them?

255
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,587
The president issued a blanket pardon.

256
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,348
They were all forgiven,
no questions asked.

257
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:13,070
Colonel Tigh...

258
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:17,466
Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers,
killed dozens of people. Forgiven.

259
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:21,467
<i>Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol,
they murdered an officer on the Pegasus.</i>

260
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,189
Forgiven.

261
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:28,746
The admiral. The admiral instituted a
military coup d'état against the president.

262
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:30,196
Forgiven.

263
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,690
And me?

264
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,234
Well... where do l begin?

265
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,310
<i>l shot down a civilian passenger ship -
the Olympic Carrier.</i>

266
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,864
Over a thousand people on board.
Forgiven.

267
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:52,548
l raised my weapon to a superior officer,
committed an act of mutiny. Forgiven.

268
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:55,626
Then, on the very day
Baltar surrendered to those Cylons,

269
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:57,785
<i>I, as commander of Pegasus,
jumped away.</i>

270
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:01,787
l left everybody on that planet alone,
undefended, for months!

271
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,830
l even tried to persuade the admiral
never to return,

272
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,470
to abandon you all there for good.

273
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,020
If l'd had my way,
nobody would've made it off that planet.

274
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,070
l'm the coward.
l'm the traitor.

275
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,276
l'm forgiven.

276
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,428
l'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes.

277
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:28,390
We make our own laws now, our own
justice, and we've been pretty creative...

278
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,148
at finding ways to let people off the hook
for everything - theft, murder.

279
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:38,505
And we've had to be. Because... because
we are not a civilisation any more.

280
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:44,109
We are a gang. And we're on the run.
And we have to fight to survive.

281
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:49,819
We have to break rules, we have to
bend laws, we have to improvise.

282
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,264
But not this time, no.

283
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:55,628
Not this time.

284
00:22:55,728 --> 00:22:58,350
Not for Gaius Baltar.

285
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,745
No. You... you have to die.

286
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:06,625
You have to die because... Well,
because we don't like you very much.

287
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:09,467
Because you're arrogant.
Because you're weak.

288
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,676
Because you're a coward.

289
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,458
We wanna throw you out the airlock...

290
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:16,587
because you didn't stand
up to the Cylons...

291
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,710
and get yourself killed in the process.
That's justice now!

292
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,945
You should've been killed on New Caprica.

293
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:27,506
But since you had the temerity to live,
we'll execute you now. That's justice!

294
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,606
<i>(muttering)...</i>

295
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,990
<i>(gavel bangs)</i>

296
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,040
Order. Order!

297
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,440
This case...

298
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:46,345
this case is built on emotion,

299
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:50,390
on anger, bitterness, vengeance.

300
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,836
But most of all it is built on shame.

301
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,180
It's about the shame of what we did
to ourselves back on that planet.

302
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,505
And it's about the guilt...

303
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:06,797
of those of us who ran away.

304
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Who ran away.

305
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,466
And we are trying to dump all that guilt
and all that shame onto one man.

306
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:23,026
And then flush him out the airlock
and hope that that just gets rid of it all,

307
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:26,101
so that we can live with ourselves.

308
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
That won't work.

309
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,426
That won't work.
That's not justice.

310
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:36,526
Not to me.

311
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,860
Not to me.

312
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,585
No further questions.

313
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:52,747
Your Honours, l wish to reiterate my
strong exception to counsel's testimony.

314
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,868
<i>- (Franks) Exception noted.
- Thank you.</i>

315
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:58,308
Did you want to cross-examine
the witness?

316
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:01,589
l have no questions for defence counsel.

317
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:04,586
<i>(Franks) Witness is excused.</i>

318
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:08,086
Do you want to call any other witnesses?

319
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,104
Your Honours,
l don't wish to belabour this any longer.

320
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:18,027
The defence rests.

321
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:22,887
Very well. This court will adjourn
to consider a verdict.

322
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,320
What a glorious moment in jurisprudence.

323
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,155
You did a great job.

324
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,915
<i>(man) All rise.</i>

325
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,667
Before l read the verdict,
l'd like to make one thing clear.

326
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:21,189
Like everything human,
justice is imperfect.

327
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,585
It's flawed.

328
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:29,588
But it's those very imperfections
that separates us from the machines,

329
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:33,598
and maybe even makes us
a species worth saving.

330
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,315
The defendant will rise.

331
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,986
Gaius Baltar,

332
00:26:54,086 --> 00:26:57,545
after carefully weighing the evidence,
this tribunal,

333
00:26:57,645 --> 00:27:00,598
on a vote of three to two...

334
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,705
finds you not guilty.

335
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:07,394
<i>(uproar)</i>

336
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,520
You won.

337
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,106
Let's go.

338
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:28,628
l knew l would be acquitted,
but the fact that l was found innocent...

339
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:33,308
shouldn't disguise in any way
that this trial has been a total pantomime.

340
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:36,978
Admiral, you've gotta get him out of here.

341
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,440
Down! Bring him down!

342
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,825
Stand back! Get him out of here!
Get him away!

343
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,627
l knew right from the very start
that if there was a way to demonstrate...

344
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:05,270
the sheer...
What's the word l'm looking for?

345
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,469
Hypocrisy.
"Hypocrisy" is the word l'm looking for.

346
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:10,828
...hypocrisy of the prosecution's case,

347
00:28:10,928 --> 00:28:14,428
then the judges had no other option
but to find me not guilty.

348
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:18,188
Your boundless confidence
provided us with great solace throughout.

349
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:21,389
Look, l wanna thank you both.
Truly.

350
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:26,670
From the bottom of my heart, l am very,
very grateful for all you've done.

351
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,348
If l could've seen the admiral squirm
a little bit more, it wouldn't have hurt.

352
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,448
Now, you listen.

353
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,349
Don't push it, Doctor.

354
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,750
Fine.

355
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:48,229
Romo, um...
perhaps we could have a chat.

356
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:53,068
l've thought about a book tour around
the fleet, and there's the publishing rights.

357
00:28:53,168 --> 00:28:56,066
There are issues about my security -
where l'm gonna live.

358
00:28:56,166 --> 00:29:02,185
Since we forged this great relationship
during the trial, l thought who better to...

359
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:06,187
Actually, now that the fleet's
legal system is in place,

360
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:10,826
my not-so-inconsiderable talents
are required elsewhere.

361
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:14,545
So l'm afraid this is the end of our journey.

362
00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:17,786
What?
Wait a minute, what?

363
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:21,345
What about me?
Wait a minute. Wait, please.

364
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:23,995
Think about this for a second.

365
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,989
Where am l going to live? What am l
going to do? How am l going to survive?

366
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:36,631
Much as l hate to use
a cat metaphor, Doctor...

367
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,466
l think you'll land on your feet.

368
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:42,987
<i>(chuckles)</i>

369
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:45,722
Close the door on your way out.

370
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,480
Romo, one thing.

371
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:01,569
When you put me on the stand,
did you know what was gonna happen?

372
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,505
l knew you were an honest man,
Mr Adama, much unlike your grandfather.

373
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,325
Gaius Baltar is innocent.

374
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,325
Just the sound of it makes my skin crawl.

375
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,310
Not guilty is not the same as innocent.

376
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,389
It must have been
particularly difficult for you.

377
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:08,164
What? You just couldn't get
the other two guys to budge?

378
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,675
You voted for his acquittal,
didn't you?

379
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,385
l hate to say it.

380
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:24,359
Defence made their case.
Prosecution didn't.

381
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,746
Gaius Baltar is a traitor.

382
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:33,629
We both know that,

383
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:37,129
regardless of the outcome of this trial.

384
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,864
No one's asking anyone to forget,

385
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:46,190
or to forgive.

386
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,730
But we have to look to the future.

387
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,749
- Mr Gaeta.
- Yes, sir?

388
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:02,267
Commence jump prep.

389
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:06,277
- We're going to the lonian Nebula.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Excuse me.

391
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,150
<i>(Gaeta) Coordinates distributed. All ships
show green for jump formation delta.</i>

392
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,508
- Initiate jump.
- Aye, sir.

393
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:32,788
Jumping in three,

394
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:35,138
two, one. Jump.

395
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,580
Jump complete.

396
00:32:46,449 --> 00:32:50,709
- All fleet ships reporting in, sir.
- Very well, Mr Gaeta.

397
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:54,998
Commence DRADIS scan.
Let's see what's out there.

398
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,910
Oh!

399
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:01,836
Ooh.

400
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,160
<i>(Gaeta) Sensors show major
power fluctuations. Checking on fleet.</i>

401
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
<i>(man) Go ahead!</i>

402
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,198
<i>(static/haunting music)...</i>

403
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,866
<i>(Racetrack) Nuggets on me!
Nuggets on me!</i>

404
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,946
If you have a flashlight, turn it on.

405
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:47,825
<i>- (Gaeta) Check auxiliary power.
- (Dualla) Negative power. Batteries only.</i>

406
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,325
<i>(Adama) Get ready for an engine restart.</i>

407
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,180
<i>(man) DC6 needs to get down there
and muster.</i>

408
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,706
Gaius. It's OK.
Come with me.

409
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:23,906
- Where are you taking me to?
- To your new life. Here. Come.

410
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,467
Let's get the power back up.
Come on, people. You know what to do.

411
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,567
<i>(static)...</i>

412
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,280
<i>(voices slow down and fade)</i>

413
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,905
There must be some kind of way out here.

414
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:59,020
<i>(Racetrack) There's lots
of equipment around. It's all live.</i>

415
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,559
Said the joker to the thief.

416
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,828
<i>(static)...</i>

417
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:09,559
<i>(breathes heavily)</i>

418
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,598
There's too much confusion here.

419
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,910
<i>(retches)...</i>

420
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
l can't get no relief.

421
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,989
<i>(Tory) Hey.</i>

422
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
This isn't happening.

423
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,460
Please tell me this isn't happening.

424
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
So that's it.

425
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,669
After all this time,

426
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:45,196
a switch goes off just... like that.

427
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,230
Whoa.

428
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,290
Oh, no way.

429
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,630
l don't believe this.
l'm not buying this. This is a...

430
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,875
This is a trick. Come on!
We're not...

431
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
We're not...

432
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,907
What is that... song? I...

433
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:17,067
<i>(hums "All Along The Watchtower")...</i>

434
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
<i>(joins in humming)...</i>

435
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,184
<i>(hums)...</i>

436
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:31,344
<i>(all hum "All Along The Watchtower")</i>

437
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,180
All right!
That's enough, godsdammit!

438
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,994
Deadbolt that frakking door!

439
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,344
40 years in the service.

440
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:04,794
40 years.

441
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:07,637
Two wars.

442
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,060
Combat.

443
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:14,678
Locked in that dungeon on New Caprica.

444
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,340
Ellen.

445
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,040
My gods!

446
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,788
What about Ellen?

447
00:39:24,888 --> 00:39:27,627
No, no, no, no, no.

448
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:30,387
Not after all this.

449
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:34,996
Not after the Resistance...
and the occupation.

450
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,070
After watching my friends die
one after another for frakking this?!

451
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,348
- Sam.
- Stay the hell away from me.

452
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,947
You all just stay the frak away from me.

453
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:48,510
<i>(Chief) Sam... it's true.</i>

454
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
We're Cylons.

455
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,074
And we have been from the start.

456
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,826
<i>- (Roslin) Admiral, what's going on?
- Some kind of power surge.</i>

457
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:12,028
Give me a damage report immediately.

458
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:16,079
The power outage was fleet-wide, Admiral.

459
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,227
It was also simultaneously
restored to all ships.

460
00:40:21,327 --> 00:40:24,386
- Admiral, admiral.
- DRADIS contact.

461
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:26,668
Massive Cylon fleet on intercept course.

462
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:31,625
Gaeta, sound action stations immediately.
XO, l want emergency jump, entire fleet.

463
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:35,105
Sir, all fleet ships
were powered down during the outage.

464
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:37,505
It'll take 20 minutes to spool up FTL drives.

465
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:40,506
We just don't have 20 minutes.

466
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:43,985
Action stations.
Set condition one throughout the ship.

467
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:47,668
All Viper pilots report to Vipers
immediately. Inbound Cylon fleet.

468
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:53,349
<i>l repeat. Action stations. Set condition one
throughout the ship. This is not a drill.</i>

469
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,238
Oh, gods.
What are we gonna do?

470
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,389
The ship is under attack.
We do our jobs.

471
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:04,706
Report to your stations.

472
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:07,467
But where's the stations?

473
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:12,148
My name is Saul Tigh.
l am an officer in the Colonial fleet.

474
00:41:12,248 --> 00:41:14,827
Whatever else l am,

475
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:19,262
whatever else it means,
that's the man l want to be.

476
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,585
And if l die today,

477
00:41:21,685 --> 00:41:23,685
that's the man l'll be.

478
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,427
- Where the hell have you been?!
- l'll tell you later.

479
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:53,230
Get those steps off.
Get those steps off. Come on!

480
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,260
All right, people.
We are under attack! Let's go, let's go!

481
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,845
<i>- (Adama) Arm and load nuclear weapons.
- (Helo) Yes, sir.</i>

482
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,428
- It's good to see you, Colonel.
- Good to be here, Admiral.

483
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:39,065
- You can count on me.
- l've never doubted it.

484
00:42:39,165 --> 00:42:42,565
l'm here if you need me,
Madam President.

485
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,428
# There must be some way out of here...

486
00:42:54,528 --> 00:42:58,108
# Said the joker to the thief...

# There's too much confusion

488
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:05,184
Alert Vipers are away.

489
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:07,794
Who's in Viper Three?

490
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
<i>(electronic beeping)</i>

491
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,250
<i>Galactica, Apollo. l'm in Viper Three.
l have a bogey at my ten, l'll check it out.</i>

492
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,868
# No reason to get excited...

493
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:41,315
# The thief he kindly spoke

494
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,519
Where did he go?
Where the frak did you go?

495
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,748
# But you and I,
we've been through that...

496
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:56,877
# And this is not our fate

497
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,600
Whoa! What the frak?!

498
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,590
- Hi, Lee.
- Kara?

499
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:35,430
<i>(chuckles) Don't freak out. It really is me.</i>

500
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,873
It's gonna be OK.

501
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,480
l've been to Earth.
